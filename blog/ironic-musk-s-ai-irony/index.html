  Ironic Musk&#x27;s AI Irony

<p>Elon musk: the real life <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9219848/">Irony Man!</a></p>
<p>Just few day ago Elon Musk along with apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and more than 1000 people from AI industry signed a <a href="https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/">petition</a> to pause the development in AI.</p>
<p>The petition says:</p>
<p>"We call on all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4."</p>
<p>With this being done you might think "Oh Musk cares so much about humanity." or "Smart Musk knows the downside of too much AI development."</p>
<p>But wait wait wait it's not even one month since he signed the petition and...
<a href="https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/now-elon-musk-enters-ai-system-race-plans-company-to-rival-openai-123041600816_1.html">la la la la la</a> (News headline: News headline: "Now, Elon Musk enters AI system race, plans company to rival OpenAI")</p>
<p>Lets try to complete the quote from the petition which I had written earlier:
"We call on all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4.....So that we can get time to create our own AI. This time will give us bit of edge to actually build an AI product which can, to some degree, compete with other AI tools in the market."</p>
