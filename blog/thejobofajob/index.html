  What&#x27;s the job of a job?
</h1>
<p class="subtitle"><strong>2025-03-12</strong></p>
<p>Many know that Franz Kafka is famous for his writings, but few know that what was putting food on his table was his job of insurance agent not his writings. Similar was the situation for Ibn-Battuta. One of the greatest traveler in human history. Bro in his 30 years of travel crossed 75000 unbelievable miles in Asia and Africa! But travel doesn't pay, it was all sort of different jobs he did during his travels which kept him alive. He was working as a judge at times, but that's not what we normally remember when we hear the name Ibn-Battuta.</p>
<p>The garden of history is filled with such flowers where the job a job has only been to be used as a means to an end. Means to put food on the table, so that individual have enough energy and leisure to put work for passion.</p>
<p>But see even the husband of mother Russia - I mean Stalin the wife beater, was moonlighting as a bank robber alongside his comrades to fund the Bolshevik revolution. Even some high profile people who would later hold top positions in central committee were basically working as laborers, pulling barrow during their exile in western Europe for survival.</p>
<p>That's it for the history, coming to today, it would be wrong to say that everyone is doing jobs to fund bigger ambitions. Many are normal people who work for families. I want to share a small random interaction I had few days ago. So I was standing outside Domino's main door, waiting for someone to come. Standing there I was thinking about the exact pizza I should order, and all of a sudden someone opened the door. He must've been around 30, bald head, opened the door and said this to me:</p>
<p>"Bro you are also trying to apply for delivery?"</p>
<p>What? delivery? oh no no I am here waiting for someone.</p>
<p>"Okay, I thought you are. Anyways, are you married?"</p>
<p>Wait what? no. but why are you asking?</p>
<p>"I work as a mechanic at public transport department, the salary is merely 12,000. I got married recently, my wife is unable to adjust. They (Domino's) are saying that they will pay 30 rupees for each pizza delivery. I am thinking to work part time here after my day job."
(He still said everything with a smile on his face. Hearing that made me feel sorry for him.)</p>
<p>But it is going to be difficult for you. Did you tell your wife that you will have to do two jobs for her?</p>
<p>"Women don't adjust these days. It was our parent's generation when woman would respect whatever man earned with hard work. These days they only see the amount of money you bring to home, not how you bring."</p>
<p>There was a silence for few moments. We shook our hands, he started waking away. As he walked I kept looking at him in sorrow and he kept disappearing in the ever increasing air pollution of the city. We don't know each other's name but that 2 min interaction was enough to understand each other and we became friends.</p>
<p>He is not alone, there are many men and women who show up to demeaning workplaces everyday just to support the family. And then there are the lucky ones - the sons of god - who are privileged enough to do the jobs they love. The jobs which are means and end in itself for them: Virat Kholi, Donald Trump, Musk and everyone who love their jobs and wish to continue doing so are blessed ones. American voters fired Trump after his first term, he faced two assassination attempts, still he continued fighting and came back doing the same job. We have to give this to him - because there is no way I can even endure a pepper spray to keep my current job.</p>
<p>"Oh oh but Arjun these are the top tier jobs, of course anyone would love those privileged jobs." Yes those jobs are for sure interesting. But there are also people who do normal small everyday jobs and still be happy. I personally know one janitor who is among the happiest and satisfied human I know of. Or you can just see this video of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d6cdcNKJRY">happy 32 year dog walker</a> /s.</p>
<p>But of course majority of the people don't get that sort of joy doing their jobs. It is just the nature of the jobs. Speaking of nature, what's the job a lion? The lion preys on the zebra. Pretty clear means to an end. Prey (job) and get the zebra (reward). But what if the same lion wants to be the governor of savanna? Preying alone is not gonna help, the most it can do is to fill his belly.</p>
<p>Isn't this same for us humans? Sometimes we work, and that work can only do one thing: feed us for next thirty days until we get another paycheck. Now in this situation what is the job of a job? Just to feed you! It can't do anything more than that. But there exists even a worse thing which can't even feed you: A passion which can't pay (Probably because you suck at it). And I am no one to question your skills related to your passion here. My own writings are of such condition that they barely make much sense.</p>
<p>So what's the job of a job in the case where you are stuck in a soul-crushing, meaningless and uninteresting job but still have some spark for passion? What is the job of a job in that condition?  to keep feeding you until you cease to suck at your passion. And then, the passion will feed you. And then, you will have a job you love. And then, it is a means and end in itself. And then, you can too face two assassination attempts in exchange of your job.</p>
<p>Very few, in actuality are able to do that, but if you are one of them who is stuck in some soul-sucking job and have a passion to do something relevant. I wish you all the best from my side :)</p>
