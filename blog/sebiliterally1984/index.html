<h1 class="title">
  SEBI literally 1984
</h1>
<p class="subtitle"><strong>2023-04-07</strong></p>
<p>"Literally 1984!" that's what all our 'best' 'No 1' 'Leading' 'top' investment Adviser/research analyst must be screaming right now.</p>
<p>why?</p>
<p>why shouldn't they!</p>
<p>The way investment advisers (IA)/ research analysts (RA) advertise themselves is not hidden from anyone. What I mean is the usage of words: the promises, fake claims are common in advertisements to influence investors/consumers. After all its not a new phenomenon. Nevertheless "Dair aaye drust aaye" (Better late than never) SEBI recently issue its <a href="https://www.sebi.gov.in/legal/circulars/apr-2023/advertisement-code-for-investment-advisers-ia-and-research-analysts-ra-_69798.html">circular</a> where it issued an advisory for the words used by these IA/IR in their advertisements. To quote the circular:</p>
<p>"Superlative terms such as “Best”, “No. 1”, Top Adviser/Research Analyst,“Leading”, “One of the best amongst market leaders”, etc. so as to provide any endorsement of quality or standing of the IA/RA. However, factual details of awards received by the IA/RA from independent organizations may be included."</p>
<p>Now listen to the IA/IR:</p>
<p>"Bro its an attack on free speech! Language is the first thing every totalitarian state targets! Prohibiting us from speaking is such a neofascism. Attack on Private enterprise is a promotion for communism! Literally 1984!"</p>
