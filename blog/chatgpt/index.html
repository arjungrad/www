<h1 class="title">
  So I finally used ChatGPT
</h1>
<p class="subtitle"><strong>2023-01-22</strong></p>
<p>At first I was bit reluctant to use ChatGPT not only because of the general expected behavior of a human being to show less interest in new technology which has potential to alter the way in which the work is already done. Not from the consequence of that. I was reluctant to ChatGPT because it was asking my mobile number to signup! Yes, I understand companies these days are going pretty crazy to collect user data. moreover I understand that the devs of ChatGPT are just trying to protect it from exploitation. But still my mobile number for signing up for a service which I haven't even tested/decided to use in long term is too much. Sorry, I'm not interested.</p>
<p>ChatGPT is a new cool kid in town. Everyone was talking about it and I fell for the peer pressure. I gave my mobile number, verified everything and was ready to go.</p>
<p>At first, I was just beating the bush by saying hi/hello to that AI. Later I remembered someone saying that this thing can actually do programming on your behalf. I asked it to make some scripts for me. And oh boy! that actually worked! When I asked it to generate a script to automate a particular task and when it output the script, the feeling I got was similar to the moment when I used internet for the first time ever: MAGIC!</p>
<p>That AI is so convenient that it solved my problem within seconds which, otherwise, I would've spent hours on. I asked AI to make a bash script to output my internet download speed on terminal. And it generated that script within seconds:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>
</span><span>#!/bin/bash
</span><span>
</span><span>interface=$(ip route | awk &#39;/default/ { print $5 }&#39;)
</span><span>
</span><span>while true; do
</span><span>    download_bytes=$(cat /sys/class/net/$interface/statistics/rx_bytes)
</span><span>    sleep 1
</span><span>    download_bytes_new=$(cat /sys/class/net/$interface/statistics/rx_bytes)
</span><span>    download_bytes_transferred=$((download_bytes_new-download_bytes))
</span><span>    download_speed_kbps=$(echo &quot;scale=2;$download_bytes_transferred*8/1024&quot; | bc)
</span><span>    echo &quot;Interface: $interface&quot;
</span><span>    echo &quot;Download Speed: $download_speed_kbps kbps&quot;
</span><span>done
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
<h3 id="what-i-fear">what I fear?</h3>
<p>What is the use of my brain? Should I just know how to form a sentence which can define my problem to AI? Is that enough? It seems to be.</p>
