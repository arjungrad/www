  So You Want To Buy a Dog?
</h1>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dog lovers of the world, read my work. here i write my frustration about modern breding practices and idiot dog owners. i hope this work will help you in making better decison regarding dogs in future.</p>
<h2> unfortunate times
</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 1em">as rule of thumb when you
combine dumb people with free markets it results into
degradation of commodities. music which previously nourished
the soul of it&rsquo;s listeners has now been degraded to
simply stimulus noise. just see the top trending music these
days. now dogs are also getting freely traded in the market.
what happened with music also happened with dogs. the dogs
which previously protected the house of it&rsquo;s owner are
now degraded to clowns for Instagram. or the dogs which were
previously bred for work are now (mostly) being bred for
looks, only looks. and the only reason why dogs are getting
bred for looks is the market. the market, especially the
dumb section of it decides to buy dogs only because they
look good. that forces the dog breeders to breed dogs for
looks.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em">effect of breeding dog for mere
looks on different dog breeds:</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em">1- german shepherds which were
initially bred for courage, intelligence and muscular
strength now being destroyed because of the poor breeding of
this dog now german shepherds have problems including: hip
dysplasia[1] (decease caused by the demand for sloped back
german shepherds) and shyness.(because who cares about the
mental health of their german shepherd until he looks
good)</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em">2-Chihuahuas are bred for their
large head in relationship to the body. because of that:
&quot;Chihuahua puppies have to be born through cesareans,
because the puppy&rsquo;s heads are too big for natural
birth. There are also instances of open fontanels
(&quot;Chihuahua molera&quot;), which is seen as a breed
characteristic.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em">3- forget about diseases which
have been resulted due to poor breeding. breeds like
bulldogs can&rsquo;t even mate naturally!!!</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em">the examples of poor breeding
can include any dog breed in the market. every single breed
is affected by this.[2]</p>
<h2> lesson learned
</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 1em">don&rsquo;t buy a dog just
because it looks good. see your requirements i.e size of
your house, the amount of time you will be spending with the
dog, the job for which you want the dog whether it&rsquo;s
for personal protection or live stock guarding, check if it
matches with the breed you want to buy. it often happens
that people buy the wrong breed for a particular job. i know
few people who bought a pit bull as a live stock guardian,
and as expected results were terrifying. taking pit bull as
LGD is like giving wolves the responsibility of guarding the
sheep.</p>
<h2>dog vs toy dog
</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 1em">a dog is one who gets food
because he does some work. whether it&rsquo;s protection of
house or live stock or maybe working at border and so on. on
the other hand toy dog is one who gets food only because he
looks good. a dog has to work, a toy dog has to merely
exist.</p>

<h2>the best breeder in the world
</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 1em">natural selection is the best
breeder. and where it can be found? in the native breeds of
your country. i&rsquo;m here only talking about those native
dogs who have the least human intervention in their
breeding. i.e no poor selective breeding. every country has
their native breeds. if possible go for them. there are
multiple good reasons for that. first of all nature has made
them according to the local environment, so that the chances
of putting a dog made for cold weather into a hot
environment can be eliminated.(there are many idiots who are
breeding huskies in thar desert, India. secondly, as native
dogs are made by the nature they are more healthy than those
fancy toy dogs. it will save you a good chunk of money which
you would have spent on your dog&rsquo;s diagnosis. third,
native breeds are way more cheaper than those fancy ones,
and often you can just get them for free, if you know where
to go.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em">but be aware that there are also
many local breeders who do poor breeding of native breeds.
it would be a good idea to get a native puppy from the
villages where the only breeder is natural selection. and
natural selection is the only breeder which can be
trusted.</p>
