<p>This page includes some of the questions you may or may not have for me.</p>
<h3>Why does this website look the way it looks like?</h3>
<p>I get what you mean, this web design looks bit old and simple but that's intentional. I use Zola static site generator to build this website, it creates simple website.</p>
<h3>What's your setup?</h3>
<p> A mid range Acer laptop with Ubuntu on. I was hopping between MX, Linuxmint and Fedora previously but for now Ubuntu seems okay. Maybe someday will try Arch.</p>
<h3>I have noticed multiple mistakes in your writings.</h3>
<p>Yes, I suspect more so in old articles. I am aware about the silly grammatical, spelling and structural errors but as I wrote them a long ago and as per my best understanding at that time I tried to correct them. But it has been quite some time and it's not worth to correct them, not because I am arrogant or lazy but I just want to be open with my flaws. And I won't adulterate my writings with AI just to look perfect on the internet.</p>
<h3>Age?</h3>
<p style="text-align:center"> 24</p>
<h3>Country?</h3>
<p style="text-align:center"> India</p>
<h3>Hotel?</h3>
