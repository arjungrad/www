          <description xml:base="https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/war-as-the-new-roman-circus/">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Give them bread and circus and they will not revolt.&quot; said Roman poet Juvenal. &quot;brooooo....!&quot; probably replied the Roman king Maximus as the the idea to start Roman circus hit his brain. For &#x27;games&#x27;, there were many. For &#x27;bread&#x27;, it was already coming from Egypt. It was only the public unrest that was not in control, but the circus paved the way! Roman emperors started one of the first documented state-sponsored distraction to prevent any revolt from the public regarding growing inequality, poverty and political struggle.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, moving forward to today the situation is quite different from what it was under the Roman rule. If any nation would want to try distracting its public from the real issues the traditional roman circus might not give the best results. For A- the population is way more and running so many real state sponsored circus might not be possible. B- People want consistent stimulation on their screens to be actually distracted. I remember reading somewhere that many people these days are doing something called &#x27;casual movie watching&#x27; where they turn on their Netflix but do not actually watch the TV, instead they scroll on their phone while the movie is playing in the background. Such people would never show up to a state sponsored stadium to see random people running and jumping. Forget getting distracted by them!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, comparatively the basic public need of belly and mind (bread and game) has changed as more stimulant in both food and entertainment is getting demanded. I mean see people these days don&#x27;t even laugh on the memes which were a major laughing stock in early teens. Try sharing an old meme and most probably you will get a reply that its a &#x27;dad joke&#x27;. More and better source of entertainment is required as a true alternate of roman circus.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So exactly what an aspiring dictator or a failed state head should do to distract public? Movies, games and bread are already there but what if despite all this people have started to see the underlying problems of a state and have started to question? What should the head of a failed state do? And whatever circus he might start it must provide equivalent if not more stimulus which a roman citizen might have gotten upon seeing a man being executed by pulling apart by four chariots in the roman circus. So can a war be good alternate for roman circus in modern times? Che, the state head, start a war for public appeasement?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes yes a war can make people forget about not-so-good things happening under my rule. and hatred towards enemy will give nationalism a rise in their hearts. War is the solution&quot;- the head of a falling state may say - &quot;But..but the war must be controlled if it escalates into a real war it might backfire me. But if it is controlled and less tense then it won&#x27;t be much of an entertainment for the public. No no, the media is in my hand. Yes I will order them to exaggerate our military actions, undermine that of the other side&#x27;s. And yes I must choose a weak enemy just in case. And if any international media starts to show alternate facts I will ban them. Moreover Twitter accounts of everyone from the enemy state will be in the banned list. Twitter follows rule of the land in which it operates. My land, my rules! ban ban ban! Haha I have solved this problem. Given them bread, will show them the game now, and they will not revolt.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can such a thing work? Can war ever be used for mass appeasement? Is it being done? Has anyone ever done it? I don&#x27;t know. But the basic idea that someone from middle class who wakes up at 10am on a fine weekend morning, on his cushiony bed, opens his twitter&#x2F;TV and see stimulating visuals that his team is bombing and killing the enemy team. He enjoys this far-far away from the border where the real but controlled war is being fought, men are dying. Will the consumer of such state-sponsored appeasement stop for a moment and question about corruption and economic slowdown? He will continue the consumption and meanwhile the real condition of the state will keep getting deteriorated with more and more corruption, divide between citizens, income inequality, attack on free speech and more state control. This continuous public appeasement of war might condition the public to be hyper nationalistic and blood hungry that societal situation will go so down that even a literal war may seem least harmful thing happening at that point.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who will be to blamed? The head of the failed state? or the consumer of such appeasement? Or maybe as long as this bread and game is going on no one will stop to blame anyone. News channels will get TRP, people the amusement and politicians the power.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Shoutout For The Walking Project</title>
          <pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
          <author>Unknown</author>

          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/thewalkingproject/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/thewalkingproject/">&lt;p&gt;The most successful inventions are the one which becomes invisible after sometime. Think of comb for a moment and imagine a world where there is no comb. It is such a simple technology but it makes our lives so, so much better. Despite its significance we don&#x27;t usually stop and think much about it. Quite understandable as comb is just one among hundreds of technologies we use every single day.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, comb is not the only technology which gets massively overlooked as there is one more successful technology with same fate which has been thrown to the annals of dark room especially if you belong to any country with basic infrastructure and citizens with common sense - footpaths.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Footpaths are simple technology yet they are able to save so many lives and makes waking safe and enjoyable. My praise for footpath might sound very much unnecessary for the one who is living in a better world where having footpath is just a fact of life. But someone who is not in such a condition I must share a horrifying fact which I got to know from Perplexity search - That in 2021 there were around 29,200 pedestrian deaths in India. TWENTY NINE THOUSAND AND TWO HUNDRED! Most of them could have been prevented if there were to be a working footpath infrastructure.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time when that many people died in a country it required modern weapons and an ruthless army. And at the end the whole world got to know about it. 29,200 people died in my country and my own countrymen don&#x27;t talk about it. &quot;Such a third world problem&quot; you might say sitting in US and you would not be wrong in saying that, it is indeed a third world problem. It is third world not because of low per capita GDP but because of mental bankruptcy in civic sense. Comb and footpath are not much different in the sense that both are simple yet significant technologies. Both are invisible in first world. Footpath are also invisible in my country too but not because they are successful technology but actually you can&#x27;t see them because they don&#x27;t exist in first place. And if they exist they are usually not in condition to be used as they are often encroached, unmaintained, and there might actually be an open sewage on footpath it can be your free ticket to hell.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if we try to find why there is no basic footpath infrastructure in India the answer might come down to two reasons:
1- Citizens don&#x27;t care. Even if there is footpath people are reluctant to use them.
2- If citizens don&#x27;t want footpath, why should bureaucracy build them in first place?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why 29,000 people dying every year is not enough for the citizens to demand for footpaths and spread awareness?&quot; Well I don&#x27;t have the answer for that. It seems like Indians don&#x27;t actually care and don&#x27;t understand how big that number is. After all 29,000 is merely 0.000207% of 1.4 billion Indian population. Now you understand that these numbers are rookie numbers. These numbers might call for national emergency in US but no, not in India.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=resmid src=&quot;&#x2F;pix&#x2F;25&#x2F;footpath.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;img&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, not everything is an episode of Black Mirror. Let me tell you why - Remember that brave thing trump said just a moment after a bullet kissed his ear - &quot;Fight! Fight! Fight&quot;. Yes, that is the exact thing which &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.walkingproject.org&#x2F;home&quot;&gt;&#x27;The Walking Project&#x27;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is trying to do for creating &quot;safe, convenient &amp;amp; joyful walking experience&quot; in India by fighting for footpath infrastructure in Mumbai.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now of course building basic footpath infrastructure is not rocket science but being able to do such a thing in India is no less difficult as it involves changing public conscience and a consistent battle with the world famous Indian bureaucracy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me share one incident which happened with me:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few months ago I walked into a UK based manufacturing company for a work meeting. After completion of the security procedure, I started walking on the road which was going straight to the building. As soon as I could finish 20 steps the security personnel screamed from behind &quot;Anna bla bla bla&quot; I didn&#x27;t get his words but I understood his expressions &quot;Anna, use the zebra crossing and then the footpath. Don&#x27;t walk on the road, its for vehicles&quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Indian mind couldn&#x27;t comprehend, for my whole life I walked wherever I could. This was new to me. But what was more interesting was once I crossed the zebra crossing and entered the footpath. &#x27;Entered&#x27; because once you start walking on footpath there is no way out - the railings between footpath and the road prevents the walking person from getting back on the road. And also a safety measure in case some uncontrolled car jumps over the road and runs over the footpath.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For that one hour I had escaped India. It was a little bubble of a civilized country. What it took was basic infrastructure and common sense. Just that.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But life is again Indian outside those little bubbles. That&#x27;s why what &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.walkingproject.org&#x2F;home&quot;&gt;&quot;The Walking Project&quot;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is trying to do is something which I highly respect and I look forward to donating to them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Over-Informed, Under-Informative</title>
          <pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
          <author>Unknown</author>
          <link>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/over-informed-under-informative/</link>
          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/over-informed-under-informative/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/over-informed-under-informative/">&lt;p&gt;What if your mind - and mine too - is like a box which can fill at any given point of time, at most, one thousand facts in it. It is a box, it has a limit on how much it can store. It is restricted by the space in it. Such that if you learn five new facts, your brain must dispose five older ones to make space for the new five facts. But ever since we were born our senses are feeding our brain with all sorts of information. As a result, every passing moment we are storing and discarding plenty information simultaneously. Now keeping the facts as they are, let me ask you, if you knew about this &#x27;limited facts capability&#x27; of brain, would you still be engaging in deliberately collecting less important information? I am asking this because I am doing this all the time when I open a social media app.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might rightly say that it&#x27;s not actually how our brain works. You may be right, I have no study to back it up. However, common sense suggests that reality must not be far from the fact that we can store facts only to an extent in our brain. Moreover, if you still wish to criticize, this idea is not a creation of my mind, I merely copy pasta it from Sherlock Holmes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would surely come back to this question again. For now, let me share why I came up with this question at all. Do you remember those days when major chunk of our internet experience was to deliberately search a particular term on google and get the information we asked for? Like we would go on internet with a question or search query in mind, get the information and come back. And even the peculiarity of that activity is that you will only get the results which are related to your search query. The homepage of google.com will give you no other information but a search box which will take you to that corner of the internet you searched for.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course this is something which you still can replicate on google: Decide exactly what information you would want to consume. However, google is not anymore the only place where we generally spend our time on - Instagram, Twitter, Youtube, Reddit etc. are the virtual places we also usually spend our time on. As you may already know that the bombardment of information which we get from these apps is the kind of information which we don&#x27;t have much control on. For instance, lets say its evening time, you have yet to decide what to eat for dinner, and out of habit you open twitter for no particular reason, you land on the &#x27;for you&#x27; page on the app. All of a sudden, 5 minutes down, you find your mind caught up in the latest controversy going on between two individuals and by this time you have read as many posts that now it is next to impossible not to take a side. Even though you didn&#x27;t deliberately decided to get to know about this controversy. Nor did you put any keyword in the search box related to those people, but you now know lot of useless information about two groups fighting on internet for a topic which has no real life implication on you. But you have given enough attention to them that it has now taken over your mind. And what were you thinking about before opening the app? dinner? oops! 5 min twitter experience led to 30 min voyage for the lookout of new and hot information. Now you have no other option but to eat whatever is left in the fridge or just go out to some fast food chain - Where you will indulge into the consumption of the same controversy while your order gets prepared. Sounds like an extreme case? Well I am guilty of having this once. Or maybe even more times, I can&#x27;t recall at this point. Scary!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I am not the first one to say these things. We all are aware about this already. At this point this phenomenon is part of almost all of our daily lives. We do get lot of unintended uninformative information. This fact alone might make us start think ill about these apps. But these apps are not entirely evil. I mean yes they do bombard us with lot of noise on &#x27;for you&#x27; pages, but similar to &#x27;for you&#x27; there is also this page called &#x27;subscribed to&#x27; or &#x27;from people you follow&#x27; where at least you know that you will only be getting information from the people you intentionally clicked on the follow button. Even though you don&#x27;t have much control on what your following may post but you have a rough idea what it may be. While &#x27;for you&#x27; will bombard you with whatever is trending currently (or something related to your previous engagement or some more stimulating and hot content).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering that, despite us knowing the destructive impact of such suggestive hot topics on our thinking, our rationale still fails us to deter us from opening &#x27;for you&#x27; pages every time we get even minimally bored. What I have seen from my observations is that we generally tend to spend more time on &#x27;for you&#x27; pages on Instagram and Twitter comparatively to the page which only gives feed from your following. Maybe because our rationale creates that facade of &quot;oh by using these apps I am learning so much&quot; - yeah lot of useless information. That makes me remind the quote that our mind is good at fabricating all the reasons to do the things which we want to do.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason behind spending so much time on &#x27;for you&#x27; page might be that what we have on our &#x27;followed page&#x27; is no more our actual interest. That we have have lost interest in the things which we have followed. Or it could be just that we are not at all opening these apps to get information. Rather to use these apps as time filler - stimulus giving - experience apps. It seems quite clear that in a situation where we are looking just to have an stimulus providing experience for the 5 min break on work, we couldn&#x27;t care less about information or feeds from the accounts we follow. Au contrary, more spicy post means more engagement from our side.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it can&#x27;t be true for all the situations. Sometimes we do feel that the time spent on these apps are not wasted as we end up learning so many facts: A post about Trump&#x27;s latest comments on Ukraine. Or how a human will die if he is left in space without any equipment for 5 minutes and so on. This is indeed some information. But are they really informative?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now coming back to the question I had put in the start: If our minds can be filled with only a finite number of facts. And filling new facts requires getting rid of older ones. Despite this situation why do we continue to stack piles after piles of useless information by getting rid of some important facts? Or maybe if that is not how it works, then at least this mindless scrolling for sure takes our attention to the matters which are not related to our lives. Here I am not bashing social media, but only the aspect where unintended information takes our attention. If I am getting content from the people I follow, it would still seem fine. But for now, the &#x27;for you&#x27; page has taken over my time. And I believe that I am not the only one who is battling this time-draining activity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand the enemy marches towards you with relentless belligerence. There it comes glittering with its compact screen. With only minimal requirement to be activated. Always ready to please you with its package of stimulus bundled with useless information. Conquering that and moving to a more fulfilling option such as maybe reading a book - or conversation with other humans - will test your strength and belief in god. But rationality and comfort alone can&#x27;t be relied upon to fight this enemy of rat in size, but mammoth in its strength. Where have the rationality and comfort have taken us if not on &#x27;for you&#x27; page?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>What&#x27;s the job of a job?</title>
          <pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
          <author>Unknown</author>
          <link>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/thejobofajob/</link>
          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/thejobofajob/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/thejobofajob/">&lt;p&gt;Many know that Franz Kafka is famous for his writings, but few know that what was putting food on his table was his job of insurance agent not his writings. Similar was the situation for Ibn-Battuta. One of the greatest traveler in human history. Bro in his 30 years of travel crossed 75000 unbelievable miles in Asia and Africa! But travel doesn&#x27;t pay, it was all sort of different jobs he did during his travels which kept him alive. He was working as a judge at times, but that&#x27;s not what we normally remember when we hear the name Ibn-Battuta.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The garden of history is filled with such flowers where the job a job has only been to be used as a means to an end. Means to put food on the table, so that individual have enough energy and leisure to put work for passion.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But see even the husband of mother Russia - I mean Stalin the wife beater, was moonlighting as a bank robber alongside his comrades to fund the Bolshevik revolution. Even some high profile people who would later hold top positions in central committee were basically working as laborers, pulling barrow during their exile in western Europe for survival.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#x27;s it for the history, coming to today, it would be wrong to say that everyone is doing jobs to fund bigger ambitions. Many are normal people who work for families. I want to share a small random interaction I had few days ago. So I was standing outside Domino&#x27;s main door, waiting for someone to come. Standing there I was thinking about the exact pizza I should order, and all of a sudden someone opened the door. He must&#x27;ve been around 30, bald head, opened the door and said this to me:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Bro you are also trying to apply for delivery?&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What? delivery? oh no no I am here waiting for someone.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Okay, I thought you are. Anyways, are you married?&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait what? no. but why are you asking?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I work as a mechanic at public transport department, the salary is merely 12,000. I got married recently, my wife is unable to adjust. They (Domino&#x27;s) are saying that they will pay 30 rupees for each pizza delivery. I am thinking to work part time here after my day job.&quot;
(He still said everything with a smile on his face. Hearing that made me feel sorry for him.)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is going to be difficult for you. Did you tell your wife that you will have to do two jobs for her?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Women don&#x27;t adjust these days. It was our parent&#x27;s generation when woman would respect whatever man earned with hard work. These days they only see the amount of money you bring to home, not how you bring.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a silence for few moments. We shook our hands, he started waking away. As he walked I kept looking at him in sorrow and he kept disappearing in the ever increasing air pollution of the city. We don&#x27;t know each other&#x27;s name but that 2 min interaction was enough to understand each other and we became friends.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is not alone, there are many men and women who show up to demeaning workplaces everyday just to support the family. And then there are the lucky ones - the sons of god - who are privileged enough to do the jobs they love. The jobs which are means and end in itself for them: Virat Kholi, Donald Trump, Musk and everyone who love their jobs and wish to continue doing so are blessed ones. American voters fired Trump after his first term, he faced two assassination attempts, still he continued fighting and came back doing the same job. We have to give this to him - because there is no way I can even endure a pepper spray to keep my current job.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh oh but Arjun these are the top tier jobs, of course anyone would love those privileged jobs.&quot; Yes those jobs are for sure interesting. But there are also people who do normal small everyday jobs and still be happy. I personally know one janitor who is among the happiest and satisfied human I know of. Or you can just see this video of a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=8d6cdcNKJRY&quot;&gt;happy 32 year dog walker&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; &#x2F;s.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of course majority of the people don&#x27;t get that sort of joy doing their jobs. It is just the nature of the jobs. Speaking of nature, what&#x27;s the job a lion? The lion preys on the zebra. Pretty clear means to an end. Prey (job) and get the zebra (reward). But what if the same lion wants to be the governor of savanna? Preying alone is not gonna help, the most it can do is to fill his belly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn&#x27;t this same for us humans? Sometimes we work, and that work can only do one thing: feed us for next thirty days until we get another paycheck. Now in this situation what is the job of a job? Just to feed you! It can&#x27;t do anything more than that. But there exists even a worse thing which can&#x27;t even feed you: A passion which can&#x27;t pay (Probably because you suck at it). And I am no one to question your skills related to your passion here. My own writings are of such condition that they barely make much sense.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what&#x27;s the job of a job in the case where you are stuck in a soul-crushing, meaningless and uninteresting job but still have some spark for passion? What is the job of a job in that condition?  to keep feeding you until you cease to suck at your passion. And then, the passion will feed you. And then, you will have a job you love. And then, it is a means and end in itself. And then, you can too face two assassination attempts in exchange of your job.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very few, in actuality are able to do that, but if you are one of them who is stuck in some soul-sucking job and have a passion to do something relevant. I wish you all the best from my side :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Trying to Fix Inefficient Vendor Meets</title>
          <pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
          <author>Unknown</author>

          <description xml:base="https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/trying-to-fix-inefficient-vendor-meets/">&lt;p&gt;Bureaucrats are some of the most credible gang members as they seldom snitch on their collective wasteful activities. At this point it is a widely accepted notion that even the most fertile kind of land gets turned into most barren and lifeless one the moment it get touched by the bureaucracy. I believe, much has already been written about this peculiar characteristic of the bureaucracy. That&#x27;s why today I want to write something very specific. Let&#x27;s break the ice, in the last one year, because of my job I have had the misfortune of attending these government organized &#x27;Vendor meets&#x27;, &#x27;MSME conclaves&#x27; (conclave for small businesses), investment summits&#x27; and (insert names for other events organized by the government to increase the collaboration between PSUs and private sector undertakings).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment summits and vendor meets are rare occasions when the government and private sector collaborate together to successfully organize an inefficient and wasteful event. If by any chance you have been to any such event, I am very much sure that you would agree with my last statement. Now I must say that the idea behind organizing such events is noble: To get investment for small businesses, improve PSU &amp;amp; vendor relationship by providing a platform to discuss possible issues. Not only that, vendor summits allows small and medium size businesses to present their product&#x2F;service to officials of PSUs (public sector units). it is a dream opportunity for businesses to become a vendor to PSUs. Overall the idea is to strengthen the private sector with better collaboration with PSUs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite having honest intentions, these summits are plagued with the inherent characteristics of good old bureaucracy. As I said in my first line that bureaucrats never snitch on each other, but since vendor meets are such occasions when both bureaucrats and private individuals are on the same stage, it becomes almost impossible to hide how carelessly tax payers money is spent while organizing such events. And let me just give you some examples to this before I try giving possible solution:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1- &lt;strong&gt;Expensive hotels&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;
In my experience of asking high ranking bureaucrats about what was taught to them during their training period, usually I get this sort of reply &quot;We were taught about dressing sense, how to eat, different kind of spoons, table etiquette and so on basically they make us gentleman&quot;. Organizing any official event in a business like setting will be shame for their king size gentleman lifestyle. Hence, any vendor meet is usually organized in five star hotel where these professionally trained gold diggers can enjoy french bread with ten different spoons while they keep uttering rubbish to each other in their fake British accent while completely forgetting the real reason why the meet was hosted for.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might have been bit harsh in the last paragraph, but seeing all this happening as a taxpayer is bit tough.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2- &lt;strong&gt;Merely a checkbox activity for bureaucrats&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay see, Let me ask a business representative that with what goal he is attending such an event? &quot;Well I either want investment or want new contact sighed from these government companies as I really want to become one of their vendors&quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now lets ask the same question to the bureaucrat as why did he attend such event? &quot;Every year we have to organize two of such events that&#x27;s why I am here.&quot; that&#x27;s it. The only reason a govt. official might be attending a vendor meet or investment summit is because he has to. Apart from that there is no goal which he has to achieve by attending such event. If forced he might say that a free exotic lunch and a get together with his colleagues along with a day off work is his prime goal. But yes there are some officials who also have to give speech. The speeches which are, simply put, general off topic - self flattery monologues.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How things can be made better:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might not be the expert on process improvement, but as a common man with some experience of attending such events in both public and private firms I can see two things which private companies have and government ones lack. These are the changes which can drastically improve the productivity of such government organized events:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1- Setting up of goals&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No I am not asking our lord like bureaucrats to set performance goals and work. They are lords they should not work, they are above us taxpayers. But basic goals can be set before the initiation of the vendor meet or investment summit. Maybe the goal can be to improve lets say furniture procurement in a big PSU. The point I am trying to make for setting up this goal is that when this is shared to the vendors during to vendor meet, a productive discussion can be initiated. As vendors from different sectors are already there they can give some recommendations. But no, currently the goals are kept hidden in the muddy self flattery speeches given by the officials.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2- Reducing the number of bureaucrat attendees or making them accountable&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the peculiarity of government enterprise to send three men for the job of one man. But what I have found is that this proportion goes to wild extent during vendor meets. I will give you one example. There was this vendor meet organized by one the the biggest PSU of my country, 60% of the seats in that 5 star hotel was occupied the bureaucrats. And no one but bureaucrats were allowed to present their ideas in front of the audience. At its peak it was like a meet setup by bureaucrats for bureaucrats, the only thing which was reserved for vendors was the name of the event &quot;Vendor meet&quot;. But this was just the start, right before the lunch started the hotel was all of a sudden got invaded by at least a hundred other bureaucrats. And the most ironical thing was that it was the vendors who had to pay INR 3000 per head to attend the meeting. And the government employees following their peculiarity were free loaders. Well, there presence is enough I guess. So much presence that for every one vendor there were at least 10 bureaucrats during lunch time. Who decided to form their own high class groups keeping vendors aside from entering their &#x27;gentleman conversations&#x27;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this only happened because the officials who joined have no one to report to after the meet ends. While on the other hand each employee from a vendor company has to make a report, present it to the management, follow up with the opportunities and strive for closure. And what will those outnumbered bureaucrats do after the end of the meet? well they will probably go to their home and sleep on comfortable king size bed and perhaps think about the promotion which they are sure to get after the completion of 5 years as per government policy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If and only if these officials can be held accountable, and responsibilities can be set to improve the procurement in their respective departments by making the current issues public to the businesses. If this is done the vendor meets and investment summits can serve the real purpose they were built for.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I must add that vendors are not dumb, they know how lazy and careless an average bureaucrat is. Vendor uses this loophole to sell overpriced inferior products to PSUs. Which ends up harming the taxpayer&#x27;s money&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As time proceeds and the facade of vendor and investment summits goes away, it is becoming the public knowledge that how inefficiently organized these events are. Recently in Bhopal they organized an global investment summit only to find out that during lunch there all brown global investors started to fight each other for plates. It is time that taxpayers should be banned from such government organized events. It is not in favor of the bureaucracy that tax payers will get to know how inefficient and wasteful bureaucracy is.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subconscious thinking from the side of bureaucracy that taxpayer&#x27;s money is an infinite resource with no responsibility on spending is what makes bureaucracy an unaccountable overspending behemoth.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>How I met my first mechanical keyboard</title>

          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/tvs-gold-prime/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/tvs-gold-prime/">&lt;p&gt;So yeah, I fall for the memes...again. It has been a while since Luke Smith has gone away from the internet, but his videos keep making people fall for his memes. Considering majority of my readers already know Luke Smith, but do you remember that weird looking &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=fM-AKfknEbo&quot;&gt;keyboard&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; thing he had? That thinkpad like trackpointd in middle of that white old industrial looking keyboard? The keyboard he used to flex? Guy paid hundred dollars for it. Hundred. It didn&#x27;t even had RGB lighting in it. One hundred dollars! for a comparison, if you earn $100 a month in the capital of my country, you are technically above the poverty line. Now I am no one to question his choice, as he is from a rich country, also that keyboard looks good enough as far as my taste is concerned. It&#x27;s sturdy as well. If I were to be in his shoes I would have made the same choice of purchasing one of those cool toy. But still, even though I am not in his shoes, I still made the same decision. Kinda...I mean I can&#x27;t spend $100 on a keyboard. It is almost 9k in my country at this point. &quot;But Arjun you said that you made the same choice as him to purchase that keyboard and now you are saying you are too broke to do that..yada yada yada&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well in my defense: What is a Luke Smith&#x27;s keyboard after all?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is made in USA (His homeland)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is no nonsense, sturdy keyboard.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It doesn&#x27;t care about RGB.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Might even last Trump&#x27;s two presidencies.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke&#x27;s keyboard is US made Unicomp keyboard. If one wants that in India, then there is no option but to import. Which is a weight I don&#x27;t want to carry. So as I couldn&#x27;t get my hands on the exact keyboard which Luke was flexing. But I, instead got my eyes on an Indian version of Luke&#x27;s keyboard:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TVS Gold Prime Mechanical Keyboard&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=resmid src=&quot;&#x2F;pix&#x2F;25&#x2F;tvs-full.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;TVS Gold Prime Mechanical Keyboard&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;img&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Linus pointed out in his review that TVS Gold Prime Mechanical Keyboard is a heavenly inspired by IBM M3 keyboard. With almost identical looks and a pen holder at top (Yes this keyboard has an elevated area on the top to hold pen). Plus it offers similar things as Luke&#x27;s keyboard expect that nipple like rubbery thing which he has for some reason in middle of his keyboard. Now even Lenovo has removed those trackpoints from its latest Thinkpads. Anyways, here&#x27;s how my TVS keyboard is similar to that of Luke&#x27;s:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is made in India (My homeland)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is no nonsese, sturdy keyboard.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It doesn&#x27;t care about RGB.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Might even last Trump&#x27;s two presidencies (The box says 50m keystrokes life for each key).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one more distinction however, while Luke paid $100 for his toy, I on the other hand, was able to get the possession of mine for much lesser deal of $33. It may seem cheap for US readers but it is still INR 2900 in my country. Which is almost at par with the one-month rent I pay for the apartment I live in.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now there is this nerdy part, which I was able to know just recently that the keyboard which Luke is using is a keyboard which comes with something called buckling springs. He did mention that in his video as well but when I first watched it I had no clue what it was. So what a buckling spring keyboard is, it is a keyboard with a spring beneath all of its keys. Which, when pressed and released makes that pleasant buckling sound. Hence the name buckling spring keyboard. Idea sounds good, so does the sound coming out of this sort of keyboard. But here is the hard fact of life, these kind of keyboards are not that easily available in India. And if you are lucky to get your hands on this breed somehow, it will only be possible after a big monetary exchange.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=resmid src=&quot;&#x2F;pix&#x2F;25&#x2F;tvs-red-switch.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;TVS Gold Prime Mechanical Keyboard&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;img&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, I did purchase which I can.  TVS Gold Prime Mechanical Keyboard with red switches. &quot;Red switches?&quot; yes, it turns out that you can&#x27;t just buy a mechanical keyboard without being a little nerd. There are basically three kind of switches TVS comes with:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red switches: Easy to press, makes least noise. (This is what I am getting in my keyboard)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown: Makes slightly more sound and has a different clicking mechanism.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue switches: Rare to find these days in TVS, expensive and makes the most noise. But it is generally preferred the most.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&#x27;t have a single clue that I am getting something other than blue switches. I thought I am being able to get TVS for bit cheap because of my luck. No, it wasn&#x27;t my luck but rather my ignorance that what I am purchasing &quot;TVS gold prime&quot; is a red switch keyboard. And it is only &quot;TVS GOLD&quot; (without prime) that comes with blue switches.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, for the person who has never had his hands on a mechanical keyboard, the colors of the switches hardly matter. After all the switches will be under the keys. So it doesn&#x27;t matter which color they are: red, brown or blue (Things I have to say myself to reduce the pain of not getting blue switches).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end, I am really happy to purchase something which I could only dream few years ago. I finally have a mechanical keyboard. It looks like that which Luke has, and for now that is what matters to me the most. I am having the best key-press experience I have ever had in my life. The sound coming out of these keys, the response which every key-press gives is the best I have ever had. Yes I could&#x27;ve saved one month&#x27;s rent, but then what&#x27;s the point coming back from work to an apartment which doesn&#x27;t even have a mechanical keyboard?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>How Not to Write: episode 1</title>
          <pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
          <author>Unknown</author>
          <link>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/how-not-to-write/</link>
          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/how-not-to-write/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/how-not-to-write/">&lt;p&gt;As I have not yet reached the point where I can teach others - How to write. I can least try to show my own mistakes in writing and can show - How not to write. This is exactly one of those occasions where I have been able to find a fatal stupidity in one of my own writing which I want to share with you.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, my last written article is a piece of trash. If I had written it on paper, it should&#x27;ve been burned and ashes faxed to the devil as a proof of crime committed against humanity. But it turns out my article isn’t the only one deserving such a fate. I have found someone&#x27;s well articulated piece of garbage in a credible business newspaper.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before moving further I must tell why I am decreeing that my last written article is a piece of trash: I wanted to communicate a simple idea- Free trade leads to welfare for all only when everyone play by the rules. Otherwise, trade barriers of any kind leads to hoarding and misuse of wealth in the form of surplus as it can be seen being done by China.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#x27;s it. That was the idea I wanted to communicate. For that, and only for that I built up first 80% of my article with simple facts presented in a comical way. However, that 80% is useless, half baked comical piece, armored with a malnourished vocabulary. The intention behind that part was to pave the way for my main point. But still, it could&#x27;ve been much better if I had reserved more proportion elaborating my main idea. More examples could&#x27;ve been given to make the conclusion come more smooth - rather than being abrupt, as it does now.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it is clear that I must&#x27;ve reserved more room for the main idea. Because that is more important than the whataboutry I did in most part. Too much whataboutery snatches any sort of relevance from the article. I learned that the hard way.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But ah ha ha (laughs in devil) I have finally found a worthy opponent in whataboutery. While I write on my little corner of internet, hidden from worldly eyes, reserved only for the few who deliberately dare to enjoy the suffering derived from reading a poorly written article. On the other hand, Mr. Anirudh Singhal, chooses to spread suffering-for-all on a well reputed business newspaper. Without wasting much time, let me introduce you to his magnum opus:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=resmid src=&quot;&#x2F;pix&#x2F;25&#x2F;anirudh-singhal-article.png&quot; alt=&quot;Anirudh Shinghal&#x27;s article&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;img&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here the main idea which Anirudh wanted to communicate was &quot;to engage with china constructively without compromising domestic interests.&quot; (Line from last paragraph). Excellent idea in my opinion. But any sane person would know that US must have thought about this exact same idea before opening trade war front with China. The first 90% of his article is a common knowledge at this point. China has been a strong trading partner throughout the world. Well, there ought to be a reason why everyone calls it the &#x27;factory of the world&#x27;. But the matter of the fact is US policy makers are aware about China&#x27;s dependence. And they know how China is misusing this power. At this point China is a real competitor to US on almost all fronts. Now of all the things US policy makers know, they don&#x27;t know how &quot;to engage with china constructively without compromising domestic interests.&quot; Only if Anirudh Singhal had given more space on his article about the things US can try alternatively &quot;to engage with china constructively without compromising domestic interests.&quot;, instead of a single line at the end, it would have been a exceptional article with some real information worth making notes of. However, as the circumstances stand, this article as you can clearly see contains 90% bluff which has nothing to do with the main idea. Hence, this article, along with my last written one, is a  piece of trash, and if we had written it on paper, they should&#x27;ve been burned and ashes faxed to the devil as a proof of crime committed against humanity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Trump&#x27;s anti-cheat for free trade multi player</title>
          <pubDate>Sun, 09 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
          <author>Unknown</author>
          <link>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/trump-s-anti-cheat-for-free-trade/</link>
          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/trump-s-anti-cheat-for-free-trade/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/trump-s-anti-cheat-for-free-trade/">&lt;p&gt;It has been some time since Adam Smith and David Ricardo open-sourced the code for free trade - world arena. It is a global multiplayer game where countries participate in free trade. This free trade is &quot;free as in freedom&quot; not &quot;free as in free beer&quot; as countries have liberty to enter into trade devoid of restrictions like tariffs, quotas and other unfair trade practices. Which leads to giving more choice to companies and consumers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now like any other multiplayer game, it is only fun if everyone play by the rules. The rules of free trade is to keep it FREE (duh!) from restrictions and the TRADE part will be taken care by itself. As if the trade is free wherein all participant countries can enter each other&#x27;s market and each product is exposed to global competition. Then all the countries will be forced to produce (mostly) those commodities which they can produce in better quality with lesser cost. For instance India has a natural advantage for the production of cotton. And has acquired advantage for the production of jewelry. Both of which India exports to the world, giving the world consumers better quality with lesser price. Meanwhile, importing processors which it can&#x27;t produce domestically with same price and quality.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first not all countries were willing to play the free trade game. Some were busy playing their closed-source alternatives such as socialism and so on. But once they started to bear the cost after the end of free-trial-run, and found their economy to be poorer than free-trade counterparts, they realized it&#x27;s time to switch and opened their servers&#x2F;doors for global companies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own country was playing a closed source alternative for so long that when it unlocked its servers or market access for global players like coca-cola - my grandfather who must have been around 40 at that time had his first sip of coca-cola and thought it was some sort of sweet alcohol.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the livestream gameplay of free trade - world arena, has always been under the scrutiny as some players used cheat scripts to get edge over the other players. For instance, despite being the proponent of &quot;play by the rules&quot;, USA has itself given some of the highest subsidies to its farmers in order to keep them competitive globally. China has given massive subsidies to its EV production which helps it to keep the prices aggressively low in global markets so much as so that EU had to increase the tariff from 10% to as high as 45% of EVs coming out of china. Not only EVs, solar panels manufactured in China accounts for 80-95% share globally. These aggressive cheat scripts lead china to $1 trillion dollar trade surplus in FY24-25.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may not be right to blame only China and USA for this, almost all countries spend fortune to get more and more of the &#x27;acquired advantage&#x27;. As the age of &#x27;natural advantage&#x27; has become stagnant, countries must get acquired advantage over the production of new technology to keep staying competitive. Actually not only &#x27;competitive&#x27; but to gain wealth in the form of &#x27;trade surplus&#x27; which can be channeled to fuel the military and reach geopolitical ambitions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This situation is leading to far worse consequences, countries are now losing trust on free trade. &quot;Too many cheaters in the global server as&quot; they as an argument to foster indigenous products. Although there is nothing wrong with fostering indigenous products but for how many products can you go indigenous? As no single country can be the master of all trade. It can, at best, produce handful of HSN codes with acquired or natural advantage. That&#x27;s why going all indigenous is not the solution. So what is? Well I guess someone has the solution.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;trumps-s-anti-cheat-tariffs&quot;&gt;Trumps&#x27;s anti-cheat tariffs&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As any sort of global welfare can only be achieved if there is trade equilibrium. That was the assumption by Adam Smith and Ricardo. But the countries which would want to hoard wealth, take trade surplus in order to be stronger apolitically must be corrected. Because these efforts lead to unfair trade practices as we have seen in the case of China. Now, what could be a better way to correct than direct high tariffs? i.e Tariffs imposed by group of democratic, free trade proponent countries. But then again it is complicated to gain general consensus to tariff bad players. There are already institutions like WTO, but more or less they have been unsuccessful to punish unfair trade practices. However, a two tier tariff model can be proposed, wherein democratic countries can come together and build common tariff policy, lower tariffs for democratic and &#x27;free trade good bois&#x27; and higher slab rates for undemocratic and shady trade practicing countries.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as trade policies are forever changing, this group of democratic and free trade proponent countries can make it such that they would revive their tariffs every three years. Meanwhile whichever country, within the group or outside the group, which practiced unfair trade can be punished and vice-a-vera.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chances of this actually happening may be less, but there is no other choice. If all the countries play the free trade game by rules, there will be welfare for all. But if bad players with cheating tactics (unfair trade practices) are allowed equal access, they will end up sucking all the wealth from &#x27;we-play-by-the-rules&#x27; countries.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the time when democratic, free-trade proponent countries must come together. Stand straight. And take bold steps against unfair trade practices by imposing higher tariffs from all sides.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>What&#x27;s Wrong With Objectifying?</title>

          <description xml:base="https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/whatswrongwithobjectifying/">&lt;p&gt;I used AI cross-species translator app to chat with one of my dog friend. Apparently he is not happy that I am objectifying him as a source of happiness. The dog protests that he is more than just a depression treatment. You might be thinking what nonsense I am talking about but wait I will explain you everything. So there is this dog which lives in my street, he is my neighbour. If you ask him, he will probably say that I am his neighbor. Although he doesn&#x27;t have a house like mine, he is not jealous of me. Moreover, as far as I know he does not even own any roof on his name as per government records. Still, interestingly this gentleman has never stepped in a foot into my house without my permission. It&#x27;s only when I nod him with a &#x27;yes&#x27; he enters my house with a nervous posture. Even afraid to touch or smell things. Seems like he fears that he might break something mistakenly and then I will punish him. Interesting, isn&#x27;t it? a wild animal respecting private property! contrary to this gentleman I invade his household multiple times a day without even alerting him. My man is mostly in his street (his house) doing his chores and people move like they own his house. This reminds me how the concept of private property is not 100% prevalent in humans. I remember one old BBC documentary where they were showing how the Indian government was trying to create modern society on some island where there was a tribe was already living. That video showed this one instance which changed my concept of private property and humans. In that video there were some buildings which were made for Indian government officials. Those house included all the expected amenities such as fruits, fridge, bed etc. into it. This all was unseen by those tribesman before. Their desire to consume such amenities lead to many theft cases on that island. The video showcases on one instance the tribesman entered the house of a government official. He just walked in. Swiftly. He didn&#x27;t even thought for even a single moment before trespassing. For the savage, trespassing, seemingly wasn&#x27;t even a thing. For him, I assume, the house of that government official was a part of that jungle i.e the house and jungle are not two but the same thing. To him walking in the jungle, plucking fruits from trees and consuming them is akin to entering someone&#x27;s house, opening fridge to grab some fruit and eat them. There is no distinction between the two. As for the savage the jungle and house are one and the same thing. He must be believing that he can walk freely into someone&#x27;s house unless stopped by the laws of nature. What exactly strikes me is how distinct it is from the ideology performed by my neighbour dog. This gentleman dog respects the boundary of my house. Sometimes the instances like these make me realize that these beasts of the nature acknowledges the concept of private property more than that of some humans. We humans boast about our private property laws and stuff but if we in actuality respected the concept of private property there would have been no case of theft. I can leave my gate unlocked and still be sure that the beast living in my street won&#x27;t enter my house and create chaos or steal food from my fridge. But can I trust even my locked house with proximity of a human?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, coming back to the topic. Since I was a kid, I always wanted to talk with dogs. But there was a small problem language barrier. A small problem indeed because the bigger problem is already solved i.e the desire to talk. Humans and dogs do come close, they play together. There is for sure a desire to communicate. But there is no means in the form of language. Gone are those days! Recently I got to know about this AI driven cross-species translator app which allows humans to communicate with dogs. The app is quite easy to use as well. You just have to record in your language and then that app converts human language into dog-bark language. No I am not speaking nonsense. This is a real app. If &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=kkwKIM9rANQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gaydar&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; can be real then why can&#x27;t this app be? You don&#x27;t believe me? then prove &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=FNBdxWa0cGI&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this video&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; wrong where a man makes a deal with the dog that in exchange of biscuit the dog won&#x27;t bark on the man. You might choose to believe or not believe this video but the fact is I used the app to talk with my neighbour dog. I opened the app and said &#x27;Hi&#x27; to him. Surprisingly enough, he didn&#x27;t reply my &#x27;hi&#x27; with his &#x27;hi&#x27;. I realised that something is strange because a hi should be one &#x27;woff&#x27; but it was instead many &#x27;woff&#x27; something like &quot;woff woff woff woff so on and so forth&quot;. Hence, instead of his &#x27;hi&#x27; for my &#x27;hi&#x27; he made a complaint to me: &quot;Listen brother&quot; the app barked...I mean translated his bark &quot;it would be nice if you stopped treating me like an object&quot; object? what? and then he continued his bark &quot;You visit me almost everyday. However, the way you think of me and treat me is not right. You come to me. You pet me. for what? you do that to be happy. And only that. You see me as a depression treatment. And only that. As if I am nothing more than that. But that is highly flawed idea. Yes, I am more than just that, I am a friend of someone, father of someone, I enjoy running after cars and bark for no reason or what so ever. So when you see me only as a depression treatment it means objectifying me. And I don&#x27;t particularly enjoy being objectified in such a way.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I heard that, I got bit pushed by those words. I do get his pain. But I told myself that his argument seems to be somewhat flawed. I clicked on &#x27;speak now&#x27; button on the phone and tried to reply him. But I couldn&#x27;t. I didn&#x27;t want to hurt him. So I later thought about it myself instead of answering him right there. He said that I see him as an object, and somehow that&#x27;s bad. But isn&#x27;t everything external to me an object? The word object by the definition means something which exists outside me, as I am only subject to myself.  So seeing that dog as an object or objectifying him as a  cure for depression is not entirely wrong. Historically speaking, objectifying dogs as a source of companionship must have been the primary reason why a ferocious beast such a wolf got converted into a loyal, friendly, tail wagging ball.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But yes I should give him a benefit of doubt. He is right in the sense that there is lot which goes in his life. Which I as his neighbour do not think much about. Yes I do like when he comes next to me wagging his beautiful furry brown tail. But yes, of course he is more than just that. A father, a friend, an individual who has to struggle in order to live. Well indeed if even that dog can respect my private property and can acknowledge that there is lot which goes in my life than just petting him then why can&#x27;t I think same for him?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Remembering a Great Teacher</title>
          <pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

          <description xml:base="https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/dean/">&lt;p&gt;Sometime circumstances surprise you with gifts. That&#x27;s I guess is the nature of circumstances. One of those gifts are the few memorable teachers which you encounter in your academic life. I have yet to meet someone who can&#x27;t recall at least one teacher who contributed in their life for good. There is always this one teacher in everyone&#x27;s life. I have had many. The teacher in MBA who forced me to think more deeply about the complicated solutions of seemingly simple problems. To the female PT teacher who called me cute in 8th grade. And this teacher is what I am going to write about today. Not the one who called me cute in 8th grade (as much as I want to talk about that, it&#x27;s not right to share that here.) let&#x27;s instead talk about the one who used to bring simple questions to the class and expected not so simple answers. In actuality the answers were simple. Not rocket science. He was a marketing teacher. Guy didn&#x27;t ask to solve integration equations. He was the kind of dude who would enter the class and the first few words which will come out of his mouth would be in the likes of &quot;Starbucks launched a new flavour of coffee, it failed in the market. Tell me why?&quot; That&#x27;s it. That&#x27;s what he would say. Guy wouldn&#x27;t even tell which flavour. He would spend the whole hour asking the same question consistently. Like some YouTube video whose autoplay is turned on, but with a minor distinction that instead of other videos, the same video replays. Kinda loop mode.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in between these repetitions he gives enough time to people to guess the answer. Of course every single guess is going to be wrong. Primarily because of two reasons: one, that as the questions are not specific it&#x27;s mostly a guess game. Two, the only person in the room who has read the research paper is the professor, as a result he is the natural and sole inheritor of the sacred knowledge of that solution.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that&#x27;s the whole point, the goal of his question, as he had said on multiple occasions, was not to get the right answer. But to get any answer. &quot;Finding answer&quot; he would say &quot;will keep your mind working.&quot; People would give all sort of absurd answers, he would listen, tell that it&#x27;s wrong, gives a smile and will continue to repeat the question like a Chad. &quot;Maybe that Starbuks flavour failed in the market because they didn&#x27;t do the market research the right way.&quot; answered the beautiful looking dumb girl of the class. Experience has showed that every class has at least one of that kind. Upon listening to that, the professor replied &quot;Starbucks is a financially strong company. They can hire the best talent to do market research. Do you really think they did not do market research properly? Be specifically, don&#x27;t answer vaguely.&quot; He said that even though he asked his won question in the most vague way. Absurd answers would come from all corners of the class. One interesting thing I found, which makes him a successful teacher, is that under his presence the class participation was the highest comparably to other teachers. Everyone tried to find answer. Every single one spoke. Even the people I once thought can&#x27;t speak. &quot;Maybe it wasn&#x27;t tasty enough that&#x27;s why it failed.&quot; someone say. Professor would reply &quot;Do you really think that Starbucks would launch something which doesn&#x27;t taste good? Won&#x27;t they even taste it themselves before launching it?&quot;. I should add as well that he would also give some &#x27;clues&#x27; to the answer. &quot;In this study the clue is&quot; he might say something similar &quot; that the country in which the product failed is mostly cold so people have to wear coat there.&quot; Ah! These types of clue used to make the problem more confusing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was gentleman enough that after making all of us wrestle with our imagination for almost an hour, he would at the end give the answer and point to a particular research paper. So, as an answer to the question &quot;Starbucks launched a new flavour of coffee, it failed in the market. Tell me why?&quot; he would say something like this &quot;The research on the failure of that product found that the reason it failed was because it did not have a smell strong enough. This was the primary reason. Starbucks consumers prefer something which has a strong smell. Something which gets stuck with their coat and it&#x27;s still there after an hour of the coffee consumption.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His answers never satisfied me. I mean, you read that yourself, do you think that that can be the reason? No I suppose. But the professor would quote actual research papers. Beherhal (This word has Persian roots, it means anyways.). Beherhal, His class was like an adventure. As adventure is never about the attainment of the destination but about the on the road experience. Similarly, getting the right answer was never the goal but the consistent struggle to think of possible answer was the real adventure. And providing that adventure, is one among many reasons why he left such a mark in my memory.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is always a little pleasure to think about those classes. Someone might claim that I am intoxicating myself with too much nostalgia. To those I would answer: Life goes on, unless it won&#x27;t. We must go on, until we can. But there is no harm in indulging in little nostalgia. What is nostalgia, after all, but an attempt to preserve that which was good in the past?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>My favourite Indian authors</title>
          <pubDate>Sun, 24 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/favouriteindianauthors/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/favouriteindianauthors/">&lt;p&gt;I am an Indian. Kinda nationalist. But not that type of nationalist which you might be thinking right now. I am nationalist for the nation, for which Bhagat Singh gave his life at a tinder age of 23. I am not only a nationalist, I should stop bragging about that right here. I don&#x27;t actually like or want to brag about my nationalism but it is the nature of current events which is making me to say it loud. Wait a bit I will explain everything. First you must know that I read books, hence I am a reader. For some reason which I of course can&#x27;t share share online. I feel a sense of compulsion for sharing two of my favorite Indian authors. Well to be honest, I am being alleged by my friends that I don&#x27;t support Indian authors. That I only read foreigners. When I first heard these barbaric acquisitions against me, I myself felt bad and guilty of committing some unethical act. But that is far from truth. I have read Indian writers whether it be Bhagat Singh, Gandhi, Munshi Premchand or Tagore.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough this is not the first time anyone questioned my integrity as a nationalist reader. I remember exactly, few summers back while traveling, I found one of those library which exist at some of the most unexpected place. This library was in one of the remote part of my country. Even though the surrounding was all dusty the library was surprisingly quite clean from inside. I went inside and found no one but few racks filled with used books. That time I was really much into 19th century political economy. So a naive me started looking for any of those books. That was the time when I used to read in a narrow genre. I didn&#x27;t find any of political economy book. However I was the only one in the library but few moments later I was greeted by a mid age lady. She must be the owner of that place. I asked her about the books I was looking for. She said I can&#x27;t find those books here but can try my luck with Indian writers. Before that I had never distinguished between writers based upon there country of origin. She asked me any particular name or work of Indian writer in 19th century political economy so that I can try my luck finding that. As an answer from my side there was a silence. As an answer to my silence there was a look of disgust on her face. I could read her disgust, I still remember every single word of her disgust: &quot;What kind of Indian are you! You can&#x27;t even give a single name of Indian author of your favorite 19th century political economy genre. Shame on you anti-national reader.&quot; But she didn&#x27;t say that loud, instead she replied in a soft voice, &quot;You should try reading more of you own country men.&quot; Her soft words and strong emotions were powerful enough for me to purchase two second hand books by Indian authors from her store.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time has passed since then, I have read more both desi (Indian) and videsi (foreign author). Now is the time when I must put an end to all the propaganda spread against me by these two people who call me an anti-national reader. As said previously I have read people like  Bhagat Singh, Gandhi, Munshi Premchand and Tagore. Now I must go one step further and give names of two of my favorite Indian writers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One is a guy born in a north Indian state of Himachal Pradesh, pahadi guy called Ruskin Bond. Having being traveled multiple times to Mussoorie myself I find his &#x27;Roads to Mussoorie&#x27; to be a fine wine. It hits the soul.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=resmid src=&quot;&#x2F;pix&#x2F;2024&#x2F;ruskin.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;img&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other is a guy born in a western Indian state of Bengal, this Bengali guy is George Orwell. The author of books like 1984, Animal Farm and so on. His skill of writing facts of real life into a fictional world is unmatchable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=resmid src=&quot;&#x2F;pix&#x2F;2024&#x2F;george_orwell.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; height=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;img&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Four ways to spend money</title>
          <pubDate>Tue, 05 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

          <link>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/4-ways-to-spend-money/</link>
          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/4-ways-to-spend-money/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/4-ways-to-spend-money/">&lt;p&gt;After a day filled with complete chaos, as I came to my room to relax and sleep for few hours, as usual I turned on my laptop and came across this video of Milton Friedman regarding ways in which one can spend money. I must confess it is one of those rare small-duration, interesting and thought provoking video.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See for example the first way he tells is when &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;you spend your own money on yourself&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; you are very conscious&#x2F;careful regarding the value&#x2F;price ratio of the spending. You would want to spend less and receive more. Hence it is the best way for efficient use of the funds.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another was when &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;you spend your money on someone else&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. Here you are more concerned regarding the spending i.e you don&#x27;t want to spend too much. The amount which is being spent by you is a bigger concern than the value which the other person might receive. For example when you buy gift for someone.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third one was when &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;you spend someone else&#x27;s money on yourself&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. Here money is not your concern, rather you are more concerned about the value you receive. For example- In India if you are a government employee, the government pays the money for your health treatment. In cases like this, the employee upon getting ill, rushes to some expensive hospital. In this case he might not care about the prices.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we encounter the final boss &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;when you spend someone else&#x27;s money on someone else&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; For example - welfare fund managers. Here you don&#x27;t have to care anything about the price or value. Of course you will be accountable in a strict sense. but overall its not your money, nor do you have to consume the product purchased by it. Hence this is the most inefficient among the all ways of spending money.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is one of the best short criticism of that particular kind of economic experiment. It is only when your own money is on the table and you have to purchase stuff for yourself that best utilisation of resources takes place.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Review of my Warrior Boots</title>
          <pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/warrior-shoes/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/warrior-shoes/">&lt;p&gt;I have been a morning person for most of my life. I have no one to credit but my father for that. He has has always been my alarm. In my perspective every morning is a race between the sun and my father to see who wakes up early. Through my experience I have found that the sun loses hundred percent of the times. The reason why I am sharing this detail is because it&#x27;s quite late in the night or well I should say it&#x27;s quite early in the morning while I am writing this article. Being awake this late is somewhat unusual from my regular routine. Speaking of unusual, being awake till now is not the only unusual activity I am partaking in. Today I have decided to write a product review. Quite unusual for a guy who has preached Luke Smith in past and has opinions which are to some extent anti-consooooomerism. But that&#x27;s the interesting thing, the product I want to review is in itself anti-consooooomerism. It is a product which prevents you from consooooming too much...crap.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not talking about some app or some machine which can reduce your spending habits. Contrary to that I just want review my boots. To be specific, my Liberty Warrior Boots. For me they are the perfect blend of quality, aesthetics, versatility, elegance and comfort. Yup those are all the words I could find to describe my warrior boots. The name. Yeah I must clarify the name to tackle some potential confusion. These boots, despite having warrior as their name, won&#x27;t make you one. But these boots are definitely made by keeping warriors in the mind. Well these shoes are the industry standard for warriors, at least in India. Why am I saying that? well, Indian military buy these shoes for their warriors.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=resmid src=&quot;&#x2F;pix&#x2F;2023&#x2F;boots1.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;img&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-i-met-your-mother&quot;&gt;How I met your mother&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It won&#x27;t be ideal just to tell the specifics of the shoes without telling my story with it. After all it&#x27;s my blog so the story must also exist. Ahh...well, back then, in the old normal days, the days preceding the new normal. Ah! the audacity of people to call it &#x27;normal&#x27; when I only see abnormal these days! Anyways, in early to mid 2019 I was getting really pissed of by the need of purchasing new shoes every few months or every year. No matter how much care I took while handling my shoes they would almost always get worn out in few months. I must admit that my shoes were not of the brands in the likes of Adidas or Jordan or some other expensive brand. I am from India we have $7,130 per capita income (In comparison USA has $70,480). Per capita income might give some distorted view of reality. Let&#x27;s see another example: our government recently extended its scheme to provide grains for almost free to 800m people of our country. More than half of the population of our country comes under this scheme. That was just to show you the current condition of our economy when it comes to individual level. Now lets come back to my shoes. Even though I sometime might get my hands on Adidas or Nike, they were just exceptions rather than the rule. Mostly I had to settle with some cheaper brands. But hey no matter how light my pockets were but I never bought Abidas or Nice (duplicates). I would rather accept the reality of cheaper brands than going for duplicates of bigger brands just for the sake of name.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming back to the shoes. Whatever shoes I used to buy, more often than not they would get worn out in months. And I had to order a new one again. And again. And again. Because of this never ending unnecessary process, I decided to do some research on the available options. And I&#x27;m glad I came across the idea of boots. Yeah, what footwear can be more durable than boots? And what brand came to my mind when I heard boots? Woodland! Saw the prices. Reverse turn!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But just when I was losing my hopes on boots. I came across Liberty warrior boots. Liberty: Indian brand, Price which I can afford, quality which is even trusted by the Indian army. These shoes are exactly what I wanted. They even match my use case. Looks good on cargo pants. Match made in heaven with Denim jeans.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;durability-and-aesthetics&quot;&gt;Durability and aesthetics&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Alexander wanted to go on his expedition into Asia, just after when he became king at a tinder age of 19, even some of his closest allies tried to stop him. Similar thing happened with me when I tried to start my journey with boots. Similar to what Alexander did, I didn&#x27;t listen to anyone. Ordered my boots in mid 2020. Almost fall in love with these boots. Mostly, I used to wear these shoes almost every single day. But as life changed, also the number of times I used to wear them also reduced. But that did not change these boots to be my go to footwear. These boots were always with me, in my every expedition whether it was on mountains, plains, desert. However, the only exception was the beach. One thing can easily be deduced is that these shoes are for me what Bucephalus was for Alexander the great.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just few days ago I realised that it has been more than 3 years with these shoes and these bad boys still look young as new ones. Sometimes I think that I am done for this decade at least. I don&#x27;t need new boots till 2030. Maybe I will buy new warrior boots in 2026 or something and give these some rest. &quot;Rest? come on dude these are just boots!&quot; yes! I understand but that&#x27;s the law: If a warrior doesn&#x27;t die, he must retire after a certain age. You know they must relax too.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I am really grateful for these boots. I saved a considerable amount of money because of these, which otherwise would have been spent on recurring purchase of other shoes. One more thing to note is that, if you decide to buy these boots, I can only vouch of the Liberty ones. And even in Liberty, the ones with ISI mark. I understand that there are other brands who might be selling similar boots for little bit less price. But they might pose a big question on the quality. So that was it from my side regarding these boots. I would continue my expeditions with my Bucephalus, I mean with my warrior boots.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=resmid src=&quot;&#x2F;pix&#x2F;2023&#x2F;boots2.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;img&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description xml:base="https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/indian-steel-association/">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What is this guys! What is this! Is this how we are gonna be a $5 trillion economy?&quot; That&#x27;s what MS Dhoni would have said if he were to be the GDP Captain of India. But clearly he is not so I had to say it. And why shouldn&#x27;t I? No it&#x27;s not because I am the GDP captain of India, but I have acquired this right merely because I own this website. I can write whatever I want to. And that&#x27;s why you should too get yourself a domain. But no let&#x27;s just stop. I should stop shilling this web 1.0 utopia. Coming back to the topic, what made me question such a thing? and to whom? Well the organization in question is Indian Steel Association (ISA) and I am not the only one who has bad blood on them right now. Any sensible man who has read yesterday&#x27;s Business Standard can understand this. Let me share with you the news:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real estate market in China is currently a bear market. Chinese people are not buying real estate as much as they used to. To induce people to buy real estate China just reduced the mortgage prices to record low for first time home owners. Steel is used heavily in real estate. As the domestic demand of steel has reduced in China, the manufacturers are trying to move to foreign trade as their last resort.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are few things which we must know to understand the current condition:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India is a country which is at proximity with China which makes trade not so difficult to do.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real estate market in India is apparently doing fine as per the data. Chinese supply of steel decreased the price of flat steel in India from INR 59,938 per tonne in April to INR 55,000 per tonne in July (Mumbai prices). As a result India imported 63% more Chinese steel Y-O-Y during April-July period.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Indian Steel Association is not happy to find that Indians are buying steel at cheaper prices by importing (Now we must note that ISA doesn&#x27;t have to do anything with the country of import. As long as import prices are low ISA is mad)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I am not highly certified economist, but as most of the people, I have taken some basic classes on economics. Both in school and in college. You might agree with me here that we were always taught that cross country trade is beneficial for the development because through that we can utilize the benefit of specialization and we might also be able to get stuff at cheap prices.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is clearly happening. We (Indian importers) are getting stuff (Steel) at cheap prices. Now steel is an important ingredient in many industries like real estate, automotive, defence manufacture, transportation, construction equipment and so on. In conclusion we can say steel is an integral ingredient to build India. Getting steel at cheap prices is sure to decrease the cost and finally the prices of the products. It&#x27;s a win-win-win situation for both the sellers (Chinese) and buyers (Indian manufacturers) and buyer&#x27;s buyer&#x27;s (we the consumers of India).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is understandable that ISA is upset. Steel is their bread and butter. Come on! no one will be happy to see someone taking their customers away. It&#x27;s difficult to build a market for your product. And when someone takes your customers away by selling at cheap price, it is indeed painful.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we can&#x27;t just look at ISA in vacuum and say if cheap steel is hurting the interest of ISA it&#x27;s also going against the interest of India too. Because there are three parties from India which are affected by all this:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1- Indian Steel Manufacturers (losing customers)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2- Other manufacturers who use steel (happy as they are getting it for cheap)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3- Customers of &#x27;other manufacturers&#x27;. (happy as they are getting it for cheap)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silent majority is happy. But this vocal minority of ISA is trying to force the government to make India a more restricted country for trade. Just read the statement made by someone from some steel company in India:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;First, the Chinese mills are gaining foothold in our traditional export markets, and second, they are pushing products into the Indian market at lower prices. In response to this situation, the government should promptly consider implementing quotas for countries with free trade agreements and imposing anti-dumping duties on imports from countries without FTA&#x27;s.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If government takes any measure to dis-incentivize steel imports from china by the request of ISA, it will mark one more instance where it is clear how elite shapes the rules of game in India. I hope it does not happen. One thing is clear that this cheap steel is only for short run, once domestic demand for steel in China reemerges, this short term steel party in India will be dead again. Until then, ISA please let us enjoy cheap steel. CPI was already taking toll of average Indian. We weren&#x27;t able to buy tomatoes please at least let us buy steel for cheap.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=resmid src=&quot;&#x2F;pix&#x2F;2023&#x2F;ISA.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;img&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Why use a note taking app?</title>
          <pubDate>Mon, 28 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
          <author>Unknown</author>
          <link>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/why-use-a-note-taking-app/</link>
          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/why-use-a-note-taking-app/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/why-use-a-note-taking-app/">&lt;p&gt;Sell me Obsidian. Or any other note taking app for that matter. I want to buy it, sell me. I was influenced so much by youtube&#x27;s productivity gurus that I wanted have all my knowledge base on these apps. I tried things like Obsidian, Joplin and so on. I don&#x27;t even remember their names now, they were so NPC.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After trying all these, one after other, I found myself continuously pulling my hairs. Jumping from one app to another. There were few problems which I was encountering in every app. See for example Joplin, it takes 10 seconds for this program to start on my laptop. 10 seconds! even Firefox snap is snappier than this. Now there is one better side of the Joplin when compared to other apps: It offers free synchronization to one drive as a basic feature without requiring any additional plugin. It offers markdown support and live preview of the document. It is the best option for my needs which I have found. That&#x27;s what I thought, until I made a todo list in it and tried to notify myself for it: On my PC I received a minor notification of the task (which I ignored) and on phone I did not even receive any notification, because on phone I forgot to open the app and sync the todo data. For Joplin devs, according to their FAQ&#x27;s background sync is not a read thing. But I didn&#x27;t lose my hope, I opened the app, did the sync, and finally got the notification. But with only caveat i.e the notification was mild that it did not get my attention and I just swiped it. Ah! Joplin was all good but for to-do the notification is not its strength.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just wanted an app where I can make notes and get some to-do notifications which can induce me to complete the tasks. I have found notifications to be quite important. Generally I can make a list of items to be done in some app or text file, but after sometime I will end up forgetting that I have even made such a list and notifications exactly eliminates that.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was losing all my hopes but then I realized that I am using Linux. &lt;em&gt;&quot;Diya tale andhera&quot;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (Darkness under the lamp). Why go for big apps when I can simply use markdown, vim and git combo. There are some benefits too:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&#x27;s light weight hence fast.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I already know vim.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Markdown support let&#x27;s me have more capabilities.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Git for sync&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one thing is missing: To-do&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally sold my soul and tried Google Keep and I was actually surprised by its capabilities as not only a note taking thing but also a to-do list reminder. I set a sample task for test and I must say it kept reminding me to work. I tried getting rid of that notification but I couldn&#x27;t. Either I had to mark it complete or click on &#x27;later&#x27; which was forcing me to select time and date for that &#x27;later&#x27;. Of all the things I tried this was the only one option which made me really accomplish something.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t want to use Google keep as a note taking app for the books I read. I prefer offline markdown and vim more than that. Don&#x27;t want to be in a situation where I am not able to access my notes just because I don&#x27;t have internet access at that moment.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conclude this is what I am using:
For study notes: Vim, markdown and git
For to-do and other reminders: Google Keep&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have better solution, please do recommend me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Ban in India Ep. 2 who cares?</title>
          <pubDate>Sun, 18 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
          <author>Unknown</author>
          <link>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/banprivacy/</link>
          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/banprivacy/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/banprivacy/">&lt;p&gt;In this new episode of &#x27;Ban in India&#x27;, the Indian government follows its previous footsteps and this time makes a big leap by banning the concept of privacy altogether in India. Ahh, my previous statement might be an exaggeration, as some legal experts might point out, but hey, it&#x27;s still a significant attack on the average Joe&#x27;s privacy. Let&#x27;s conclude the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tutanota.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;posts&#x2F;apps-banned-india&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;news&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to the best of my capabilities: The Indian government has ordered all the apps that provide encrypted messaging in India must have at least one of their employees on Indian soil. This ensures that whenever the Indian authorities want any information about any user, they can easily obtain it by asking that particular individual. So, the Indian authorities are clearly asking for a backdoor. Furthermore, the authority states that apps that fail to comply will be banned from operating in India.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This request&#x2F;order&#x2F;threat from the Indian side seems quite foolish. Let&#x27;s momentarily set aside the issues of privacy and backdoors and consider this: You are a small company that provides encrypted messaging to users, and you don&#x27;t have the financial resources to establish a presence in India. But now, the Indian government wants you to have an employee on Indian land! This incurs additional expenses. And how is a small company from france with 5 employees in total going to afford that?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#x27;s revisit the news aspect again. What&#x27;s amusing, and as people like Mental Outlaw on YouTube have already pointed out, is that Indian authorities are justifying this decision by claiming it will prevent terrorism. Really? I understand that terrorism is a serious matter, but really? Do you believe that banning encrypted messaging apps will solve terrorism? In a country like India, more people die from potholes than from terrorism. Why not focus on addressing that issue instead? or maybe terrorists also use road for travell and stuff why not ban roads too?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;tagged-by-twitter&quot;&gt;Tagged by Twitter&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if that wasn&#x27;t enough, Jack Dorsey, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-asia-india-65886825&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;accused&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; Indian authorities of threatening to shut down Twitter and raid its employees if Twitter fails to ban the accounts demanded by Indian authorities during the farmer protests.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When even a prominent figure like Jack Dorsey couldn&#x27;t protect himself from the intimidating behavior of Indian authorities, one can only imagine the challenges faced by smaller apps with a limited user base trying to operate in India.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;who-cares-after-all&quot;&gt;Who cares after all?&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian government is invading its citizens&#x27; privacy. Yes, so what? Who cares?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a nation, Indian citizens are preoccupied with different topics (which I&#x27;m too scared to mention here). The average Indian Joe doesn&#x27;t prioritize privacy, encryption, or related matters. Just a year ago, the Indian government used the spy software, umm... what was it called? Ah yes! The Pegasus spyware, to surveil political opponents, critics, and journalists. But hey, I&#x27;m not aware of any widespread protest. Now they are banning encrypted apps... and I don&#x27;t see many people discussing it either. Hell, we wouldn&#x27;t have known about India banning these secure messaging apps if it weren&#x27;t for the Western media&#x2F;youtube channels bringing it to our attention.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, even though not many people read my blog, I&#x27;m still afraid to share this piece on my webpage. I&#x27;ve tried to be as polite as possible, but in India, people often label others as anti-national without a second thought. Maybe some ultra-intellectual will read this blog and say: &#x27;You are anti-national. How dare you complain about the decision to ban these apps when our government clearly stated that these apps are being used by terrorists for communication? Why do you need privacy? What do you want to hide?&#x27;. To that I would say &quot;Ask your lords to ban roads too then. If there are no roads there are no bomb blasts in cars running on road either.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>RIP Unabomber</title>
          <pubDate>Sun, 11 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/ripunabomber/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/ripunabomber/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=resright src=&quot;&#x2F;pix&#x2F;2023&#x2F;oldted.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;350&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;img&gt;
The American constitution and its consequences have been a disaster for our Unabomber. It is only with great displeasure to inform you that Unabomber (Ted kaczynski) died yesterday in prison cell. Chances are that you might have already heard this disheartening news. For those unfortunate folks who are unfamiliar with his name, I must provide a small introduction of Unabomber.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ted Kaczynski or Unabomber was a studious student who got selected in Harward for bachelors in mathematics when he was 16. Later he went to pursue Ph.D. in mathematics. Smart guy right? right. Seems like with this background he is all set for academia right? no. Well, it turns out that instead of going to some prestige university to do research. He got fed up from the modern society, went into woods, made a 10X12 ft cabin, started sending bombs disguised as mail to different people predominantly in the field of acedimia. Later he wrote a famous manifesto (Industrial Society and Its Future). This manifesto alone helped him win great number of sympathisers all around the world (of course anyone who justify the killings is a psychopath).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-unabomber-s-cabin&quot;&gt;The Unabomber&#x27;s cabin&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=resleft src=&quot;&#x2F;pix&#x2F;2023&#x2F;unabombercabin.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;200&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;img&gt;
Unabomber got fed up from society and with the intent of leaving the industrial society and its consequences, Unabomber made a wooden cabin in remote Montana, USA. It lacked all industrial society&#x27;s consequences: No electricity, no computer nothing! But yes that cabin was filled with printed books. And of course there was a typewriter too to write the manifesto.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the cabin looks somewhat cozy despite the lack of modern amenities, isn&#x27;t it?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-bombings&quot;&gt;The Bombings&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ted was infamous for bombing people. That&#x27;s why the name Unabomber (University and Airline Bomber) was given by FBI to him. That is also the reason why he spent his remaining life in prison.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-manifesto&quot;&gt;The Manifesto&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1995 The Washington Post and The New York Times published Unabomber&#x27;s manifesto &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.cs.ucdavis.edu&#x2F;~rogaway&#x2F;classes&#x2F;188&#x2F;materials&#x2F;Industrial%20Society%20and%20Its%20Future.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Industrial Society and Its Future&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
by the request on Unabomber himself. The publication was a condition set by unabomber to cease his bombing campaign. This manifesto later became such a success that it became highly popular among different people. In its manifesto unabomber proposed that how the industrial society has caused suffering and alienation in society. Ted doesn&#x27;t stop there and he later in the manifesto claims that even agriculture revolution was a mistake. Moreover, he criticized left also for its childish ideas(unironically). I read this manifesto when I was 19, And boy it really sold me this idea and I became a Primitivist for few days. #teenage.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;rip-unabomber&quot;&gt;RIP Unabomber&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The news of Ted&#x27;s death was shocking but it was inevitable. When he was free he focused his efforts in spent his efforts in pursuit of freedom. He left society for nature. He left the prestige of academic career for a simple life in woods. Well not so simple if you see the complexities of the bombs. But still for simple life. He was a big proponent of freedom. In his remote cabin he enjoyed the freedom. The fact that he had to spend his last years in prison and not in open moutains is disheartening. For the things he did wrong he got punished and for the things he did right, he will be remembered for years to come. His work is more important than ever in our times, it makes us to see things(consequences) from a different lens. And after all who knows maybe that&#x27;s the right lens. RIP Unabomber!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description xml:base="https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/ironic-musk-s-ai-irony/">&lt;p&gt;Elon musk: the real life &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imdb.com&#x2F;title&#x2F;tt9219848&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Irony Man!&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just few day ago Elon Musk along with apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and more than 1000 people from AI industry signed a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;futureoflife.org&#x2F;open-letter&#x2F;pause-giant-ai-experiments&#x2F;&quot;&gt;petition&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to pause the development in AI.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The petition says:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We call on all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this being done you might think &quot;Oh Musk cares so much about humanity.&quot; or &quot;Smart Musk knows the downside of too much AI development.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait wait wait it&#x27;s not even one month since he signed the petition and...
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.business-standard.com&#x2F;world-news&#x2F;now-elon-musk-enters-ai-system-race-plans-company-to-rival-openai-123041600816_1.html&quot;&gt;la la la la la&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (News headline: News headline: &quot;Now, Elon Musk enters AI system race, plans company to rival OpenAI&quot;)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets try to complete the quote from the petition which I had written earlier:
&quot;We call on all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4.....So that we can get time to create our own AI. This time will give us bit of edge to actually build an AI product which can, to some degree, compete with other AI tools in the market.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>SEBI literally 1984</title>

          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/sebiliterally1984/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/sebiliterally1984/">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Literally 1984!&quot; that&#x27;s what all our &#x27;best&#x27; &#x27;No 1&#x27; &#x27;Leading&#x27; &#x27;top&#x27; investment Adviser&#x2F;research analyst must be screaming right now.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;why?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;why shouldn&#x27;t they!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way investment advisers (IA)&#x2F; research analysts (RA) advertise themselves is not hidden from anyone. What I mean is the usage of words: the promises, fake claims are common in advertisements to influence investors&#x2F;consumers. After all its not a new phenomenon. Nevertheless &quot;Dair aaye drust aaye&quot; (Better late than never) SEBI recently issue its &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sebi.gov.in&#x2F;legal&#x2F;circulars&#x2F;apr-2023&#x2F;advertisement-code-for-investment-advisers-ia-and-research-analysts-ra-_69798.html&quot;&gt;circular&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; where it issued an advisory for the words used by these IA&#x2F;IR in their advertisements. To quote the circular:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Superlative terms such as “Best”, “No. 1”, Top Adviser&#x2F;Research Analyst,“Leading”, “One of the best amongst market leaders”, etc. so as to provide any endorsement of quality or standing of the IA&#x2F;RA. However, factual details of awards received by the IA&#x2F;RA from independent organizations may be included.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now listen to the IA&#x2F;IR:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Bro its an attack on free speech! Language is the first thing every totalitarian state targets! Prohibiting us from speaking is such a neofascism. Attack on Private enterprise is a promotion for communism! Literally 1984!&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>So I finally used ChatGPT</title>
          <pubDate>Sun, 22 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
          <author>Unknown</author>
          <link>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/chatgpt/</link>
          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/chatgpt/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/chatgpt/">&lt;p&gt;At first I was bit reluctant to use ChatGPT not only because of the general expected behavior of a human being to show less interest in new technology which has potential to alter the way in which the work is already done. Not from the consequence of that. I was reluctant to ChatGPT because it was asking my mobile number to signup! Yes, I understand companies these days are going pretty crazy to collect user data. moreover I understand that the devs of ChatGPT are just trying to protect it from exploitation. But still my mobile number for signing up for a service which I haven&#x27;t even tested&#x2F;decided to use in long term is too much. Sorry, I&#x27;m not interested.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT is a new cool kid in town. Everyone was talking about it and I fell for the peer pressure. I gave my mobile number, verified everything and was ready to go.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, I was just beating the bush by saying hi&#x2F;hello to that AI. Later I remembered someone saying that this thing can actually do programming on your behalf. I asked it to make some scripts for me. And oh boy! that actually worked! When I asked it to generate a script to automate a particular task and when it output the script, the feeling I got was similar to the moment when I used internet for the first time ever: MAGIC!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That AI is so convenient that it solved my problem within seconds which, otherwise, I would&#x27;ve spent hours on. I asked AI to make a bash script to output my internet download speed on terminal. And it generated that script within seconds:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;#!&#x2F;bin&#x2F;bash
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;interface=$(ip route | awk &amp;#39;&#x2F;default&#x2F; { print $5 }&amp;#39;)
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;while true; do
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    download_bytes=$(cat &#x2F;sys&#x2F;class&#x2F;net&#x2F;$interface&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;rx_bytes)
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    sleep 1
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    download_bytes_new=$(cat &#x2F;sys&#x2F;class&#x2F;net&#x2F;$interface&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;rx_bytes)
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    download_bytes_transferred=$((download_bytes_new-download_bytes))
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    download_speed_kbps=$(echo &amp;quot;scale=2;$download_bytes_transferred*8&#x2F;1024&amp;quot; | bc)
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    echo &amp;quot;Interface: $interface&amp;quot;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    echo &amp;quot;Download Speed: $download_speed_kbps kbps&amp;quot;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;done
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-fear&quot;&gt;what I fear?&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the use of my brain? Should I just know how to form a sentence which can define my problem to AI? Is that enough? It seems to be.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Bhai ka Birthday!</title>
          <pubDate>Wed, 28 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/bhagatsinghbirthday/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/bhagatsinghbirthday/">&lt;p&gt;More often than not Google celebrates the birthday of famous figures by showing their picture on its front page. I was surprised to see that there was no image of Bhagat Singh on the main page today. But anyways, its the birthday of our hero Bhagat Singh. For the ones who don&#x27;t know about Bhagat Singh : He is the symbol of bravery for many Indians and Pakistanis. Dude was born in 28 sep, 1907 and in his adulthood he became a nightmare for &#x27;samay di sarkar&#x27; (British government which was ruling India back then) He was such a pain for the government that they hanged him on 23rd march, 1931. At the time of his martyrdom he was only 23. Twenty Three! In such a short life he was able to create massive impact on India&#x27;s resistance for freedom, that even after almost a century he is still being remembered and respected by millions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I don&#x27;t see the need of writing all of the things done by Bhagat Singh in this post. But one thing I should share is that Bhagat Singh was convicted of the murder of John Saunders and Channan Singh (which were done to take revenge). Rest you can find on the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bhagat_Singh&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wikipedia&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; page.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there is one thing of Bhagat Singh&#x27;s &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=gDE0SLOw-OI&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fan&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which can be criticised that they only see one side of Bhagat Singh i.e his bravery. But negelet other two qualities - his iron will and sharp intellect. As Jawaharlal Nehru said &quot;He became a symbol(of bravery); the act was forgotten, the symbol(of bravery) remained.&quot; On these two things (will and intellect) I would like to put some light on.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, most of the things which Bhagat Singh wrote survived and passed on. When I read those texts and saw at what age he has written them and compared that with what other freedom fighters were thinking and writing at that age, I found huge differences. For me, its hard to believe that a 16 year old boy can write something like this:&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.marxists.org&#x2F;archive&#x2F;bhagat-singh&#x2F;1923&#x2F;x01&#x2F;x01.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Problem of Punjab&#x27;s Language and Script&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (It was written for a competition which he won and received a price of 50 rupees.)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only writing, our hero was an avid reader too. By the age of 18 he had read Karl Marx, Mikhail Bakunin etc. at the time when reading was an expensive hobby and avaliablity of books was difficult. No doubt he was left leaning (or even anarchist). Pretty natural thing for a young intelligent boy in first half of 20th century India. He was such a bibliophile that even on his last day, when he was about to be hanged, he was reading Lenin&#x27;s book. The book he asked as his last wish from his lawyer. It is said that the management of jail allowed Bhagat Singh to read and write as they were also aware of his intellectual abilities.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bhagat Singh was so much influenced by Mikhail Bakunin that he became an atheist, in order to show reluctance to any kind of authority. One idea which Bhagat Singh followed is that anyone can be wrong irrespective of there position&#x2F;power. In his last days people who were close to him said that &quot;you will start to believe in god once your end will come near and you will start to fear death&quot;. But Bhagat Singh being Bhagat Singh, wrote an essay on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.marxists.org&#x2F;archive&#x2F;bhagat-singh&#x2F;1930&#x2F;10&#x2F;05.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Why I am an Atheist&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his last moments when he was asked to remember God, he politely declined and according to the memoirs available he said this:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sardarji, I did not take His name all my life. In fact, when I saw how the poor and the oppressed were being treated, I even rebuked Him. Now if I pray to Him, when death stares me in the face, He will say this man is a hypocrite and a coward. So, what effect will my prayer possibly have on Him? If I don&#x27;t change my opinion, at least He will concede this man was honest.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me Bhagat Singh is a rare human created by nature (see I can&#x27;t say God for obvious reasons) with the combination of bravery, intellect and iron will.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more thing I would like to share is a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=gh7546en44Y&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;scene&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; from the movie &quot;Sardar Udham Singh&quot; (Sardar Udham Singh was a fan and friend of Bhagat singh who took revenge of  Jallianwala Bagh&#x27;s massacre by killing Michael O&#x27;Dwyer) The scene goes something like this:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interrogator: (says something bad about Bhagat Singh)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sardar Udham Singh: What were you doing at the age of 23?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interrogator: (confused by the question.) &quot;At the age of 23?&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sardar Udham Singh: yes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interrogator: &quot;I was just married...I was youngest detective constable in the force...happy days.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sardar Udham Singh: &quot;ha..so don&#x27;t talk anything about Bhagat Singh. You know nothing about him&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Exploitation of Micro Credit Need</title>
          <pubDate>Wed, 14 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

          <description xml:base="https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/exploitationofmicrocreditneed/">&lt;p&gt;Finally! the government is taking the required measures against small credit apps.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-it-all-about&quot;&gt;What is it all about?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before starting let me first introduce my readers to the situation (Even if you are not from India this might be good case study):&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all started just few years ago when all of a sudden few loan apps started to emerge on app&#x2F;play store. What these companies were doing is providing small loan to its users by taking only minimal documents. These apps performed on 2-1-0 formula - two minutes to decide, one minute to transfer and no human contact and zero collateral.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, these apps became a massive success among individuals - no need to open your bank app or take the risk of affecting your credit score in case of failed repayment of loan. Even though Indian banking system is good - according to World Bank&#x27;s estimates 78% of Indian adults have a bank account. However, Indian banks currently don&#x27;t have any expertise in providing micro loan. This is exactly the need what these small credit apps are trying to fill.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;wild-west-of-financial-system&quot;&gt;Wild West of Financial System&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of being a new kid in the street, these apps performed in their own unregulated bubble. No one was there to judge their way of working. On the one side these apps fulfilled the need of Indian people by giving them easy access to credit but on the other hand these companies charged exorbitant interest rates and used inhumane tactics to recover their loan (There have been instances where people have committed suicide as a result of threats they received from the recollection team of these apps).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;waking-up-of-big-brother&quot;&gt;Waking Up of Big Brother&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After much talk of more than two years government is finally giving some essential orders - Government has now ordered Reserve Bank of India to create a whitelist of legal apps which will be the only ones app&#x2F;play store can host.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems to be a necessary step. Moreover, the demand of micro credit by Indians must be taken under consideration and adequate changes must be implemented in Indian banking system. The changes which can create ease of taking micro credit and educating the gullible citizens.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>I&#x27;m about to Become a Millionaire</title>
          <pubDate>Tue, 23 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

          <description xml:base="https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/imabouttobecomeamillionaire/">&lt;p&gt;Ladies and gentleman its great pleasure to inform you that I&#x27;m about to become a millionaire. Contrary to &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jacobwsmith.xyz&#x2F;stories&#x2F;millionaires.html&quot;&gt;popular&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; belief one doesn&#x27;t necessarily need to work hard in order to become a millionaire. Instead one should be just adequately aware about the opportunities which are given in life. In my case I found the opportunity in my spam box. At first I thought its just another spam email but when I read it I realized that if I help a woman just by letting her use my bank account for temporary basis. I&#x27;ll become a millionaire once the deal is done. You will understand the scheme once you read the email:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FROM:  MRS BOHDANA ALEKSANDER&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;URGENT REPLY NEEDED AND CONFIDENTIAL&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am Mrs Bohdana  Aleksander the wife of Mr.Danilo Aleksander (Ukraine sunflower oil &amp;amp; wheat,maize farmer ) my husband was murdered by the Russian Army troop because of the war between Russian&amp;amp; Ukraine it was so very terrible. .&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was a sunflower oil &amp;amp; wheat and maize farmer who have invested much in agriculture political opponents.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I acknowledge very well that my Husband deposited the sum of US$10.7M (TEN MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS) with a security and financial company here in Johannesburg South -Africa with the intention of using it for the purchase of new farm machinaries and chemical for Agricultural purpose as well as purchasing hectares of land in South Africa for his investment. I got your contact through chamber of commerce .With the high risk of staying in my country we are now on political asylum. (Refugee) me and my son we are here in South Africa, my position does not allow me to open an account or to normalize this fund to any meaningful business transaction, I want you to understand that this is purely family fund not money laundering affair.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I solicit for your honest assistance as I want this fund to be transferred to your account in oversea with your partnership, I will want to invest this fund in your country.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can invest the fund as a family investment together with you in your country be assured that all the necessary document backing this fund has been arranged with one of the Attorney I meet here in Johannesburg South Africa, feel free to ask any question regarding this transaction.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoping to hear from you soonest, kindly contact me through this my private email For Confidential: bohdana.aleksander @ yandex.com&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need your urgent and confidential response towards this transaction.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks you and regards&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MRS BOHDANA ALEKSANDER&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all I would like to say, what happened with Mrs Bohdana Aleksander is definitely disheartening. I&#x27;m glad that I can be helpful for her in this terrifying situation. In my last post I said that I scream in void on my website but it turns out that even people from &#x27;chamber of commerce&#x27; read my blogs(Thanks Mrs Bohdana for making me aware of this fact). Big people read my blog and they entrust me to do big things for them. However, Mrs Bohdana forgot to mention the name of the country whose &#x27;chamber of commerce&#x27; reads my blog. well its somewhat understandable as she is going through so much hardship. Probably this is the same reason why she made some mistakes while writing English.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now coming back to the question of this opportunity. Should I take this or not. Should I act mean and not even reply or should I actually help a lone women and get rich as a result of it. Should I hide like a coward when opportunity calls or should I be the change I want to see in the world. I remember, a similar situation was once faced by Michael Scott. His quote might help me to take rightful decision:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;When the son of the deposed King of Nigeria e-mails you directly asking for help, you help. His father ran the freaking country, okay?&quot;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think missing this opportunity can be a life long regret. If I don&#x27;t help her someone else is gonna help her. I can only imagine what crazy things I can do with that crazy money. Maybe I&#x27;ll pay for Winrar or interfere with elections in some African democracy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#x2F;pix&#x2F;nigerianprince.jpg&gt;&lt;img class=resmid src=&quot;&#x2F;pix&#x2F;nigerianprince.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;nigerian prince&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Save Politics From Extreme Personalities</title>
          <pubDate>Mon, 22 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

          <description xml:base="https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/save-politics-from-extreme-personalities/">&lt;p&gt;How often it happens that we end up consuming information which is of no use to us. This happens to me more often than not when I read news. You might also have consumed this irrelevant info by now: A &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aljazeera.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2022&#x2F;8&#x2F;18&#x2F;finnish-pm-facing-backlash-over-leaked-party-footage&quot;&gt;video&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of Finland&#x27;s Prime Minister Sanna Marin got viral where, as per many people, she is participating in a taboo where she is doing evil things like dancing, smiling, enjoying with her friends in a private environment! Such a normal thing to do yet there are people who are criticizing her. It seems like because of technology, especially in free countries, politicians are almost deprived of any private life. I like Yuval Noah Harari&#x27;s take on this that Politicians should have the right to be dumb private life. Sometimes saying something stupid or doing something stupid is what makes us human. Why deprive a politician of private life? Why deprive him from doing or saying something offensive&#x2F;stupid behind the doors? Me being an average person lot of funny&#x2F;dumb things come to my mind which if I put them on internet may offend some people. So in order to protect myself from the discomfort involved in sharing those thoughts with unknown audience I share them with my friends instead. Just realized that I actually have the privilege to write offensive things on my website and still get away with it as I basically scream in void here. But politicians do not have this privilege. Just imagine for a moment that you are a politician relaxing on your sofa and suddenly your daughter comes with her camera on, a completely normal phenomenon, and she asks &quot;Dad why aren&#x27;t you on twitch?&quot; you being a boomer: &quot;I&#x27;m not on twitch because it carters degenerates.&quot; Your daughter finds this opinion funny and shares this video with her only one friend who might find it funny too and she is pretty sure that that friend is definitely not going to share that video with anyone else! And boom within hours you find yourself being trending on twitter getting slaughtered by twitch streamers and their simps. You will find yourself being framed as a fascist dictator by opposition and they will demand your resignation! All this will happen just because a completely legal private moment of a politician got leaked in public. It goes without saying that a politician with enough intelligence would never say &quot;Twitch is a pool of degenerates&quot; in a public interview or something. Now you tell me, why care about the obscure opinions of politicians as long as those opinions don&#x27;t manifests themselves in country policy. Does it even matter if a politician privately thinks that Twitch is for degenerates as long as he doesn&#x27;t go and ban the website? I believe it does not. As people continue to get obsessed with politics, private life of politicians will continue to reduce. This elimination of private life, the elimination of the right to act dumb privately has and will continue to cause a specific problem. Politics as a result of elimination of private life will only attract some specific personalities to participate in it. Normal human just can&#x27;t handle this lifestyle where he is watched 24&#x2F;7. When a politician know people are going to watch him, he acts in a different way than what he would in private. A politician has to think before he speaks. Which is not a normal human thing to do if continued for longer period. I don&#x27;t usually think that deep when I&#x27;m talking with my friends, however speaking or acting in public is a completely different thing. How long can one act as if millions of people are watching him? How long can one prevent himself from saying&#x2F;doing normal human things? The elimination of private life results into creation of mainly two types of extreme personalities in politics. One: Mainly in free world we see more and more people becoming like Donald Trump. The people with the ability to act 24&#x2F;7. There is no concept of personal life in politicians with Donald Trump personality. They will say dumb things even if millions of people are watching. Second type of personality will be in the likes of Putin, mainly in states where totalitarian tendencies can be seen. Where politicians with personality like Putin is involved no one is allowed to record him in private life. And the only limited public appearances which exist are scripted and well acted performance. Now looking back to Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin we can see that how important it is for Finnish people to not to be rude with her. Good thing is that there are many women who are sharing their own dancing &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.msn.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;news&#x2F;world&#x2F;women-are-posting-their-own-dancing-videos-in-support-of-finnish-prime-minister-sanna-marin&#x2F;ar-AA10WJkp&quot;&gt;videos&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in her support to show that dancing doesn&#x27;t make a woman witch. Like there is no need to criticize a politician for his personal life, there is no need to support him either. That what a politician do in his private life shall not be of anyone&#x27;s business unless its a criminal act or something which manifest itself as formation of government policy. Otherwise only extreme personalities will participate in politics.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Book Review: Crime And Punishment</title>
          <pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
          <author>Unknown</author>
          <link>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/bookreview-crimeandpunishment/</link>
          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/bookreview-crimeandpunishment/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/bookreview-crimeandpunishment/">&lt;p&gt;Recently I finished reading &#x27;Crime And Punishment&#x27; by Fyodor Dostoevsky. I don&#x27;t usually like to read fiction as I find it to be just a waste of time. (Although this thinking seems to be changing as I continue to read more) After reading this book I realized the reason why people tend to put Dostoevsky  on such a high regard. So, following is my review of the book:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#x27;Crime And Punishment&#x27; is like a dish where if you remove or add one ingredient (character) the whole dish will become messed up. Even after having less experience of reading fiction I did not find it difficult to follow up with the characters. The book starts with questions and confusion. In first chapter, things are happening but reader might find it difficult to know exactly what.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main character Raskolnikov, a dropped out law college student, is well explained however Dostoevsky doesn&#x27;t show all of the Raskolnikov&#x27;s conditions right off the bat. You understand him as the story proceeds. And that&#x27;s the whole point of crime and punishment: To see how poor and desperate conditions can lead to making of a criminal and what happens psychologically to the victim of those conditions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Razumikhin: friend and classmate of Raskolnikov is my favourite character. He is the life of this otherwise dead (as in depressed ) novel. He too is college dropped out but unlike Raskolnikov he is high on life. Razumikhin is a perfect friend! Without Razumikhin I don&#x27;t think I would even have finished this book.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall reading this book was like listening to a great classical music: There were different kinds of emotion flowing around but it did not lose its overall theme.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#x27;Crime And Punishment&#x27; is one of those rare books like &#x27;Animal Farm&#x27; by George Orwell where the author wants to give message but does not ruin the story in order to give message. Its a well written story! one can enjoy it even without digging deep into its philosophical message.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#x2F;pix&#x2F;Razumikhin.webp&gt;&lt;img class=resmid src=&quot;&#x2F;pix&#x2F;Razumikhin.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Razumikhin&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description xml:base="https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/babur/">&lt;p&gt;Welcome reader. Today I want to share with you one shair.(poem) written by  Babur: The man who built Mughal empire in India.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be with me, You might find it an interesting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, before I write the shair out of blue It might be a good idea to know little bit of Babur&#x27;s back story. Babur was no ordinary sperm. He was a descendant of Timur and Genghis Khan. To rule was in his blood. But life was not always beautiful for him. After many losses he was left with poverty and an army of only forty men. And even those forty weren&#x27;t able to march with him all the time because of poverty. However he didn&#x27;t quit, continued fighting, started winning battles, he started to have obsession to rule India, Babur fought and won the battle of panipat. After all the years of suffering he concurred Delhi.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life became easy, now Babur had all the riches and he was surprised by the natural beauty of India that he wrote a shair on his condition:
&lt;img class=resright src=&quot;&#x2F;pix&#x2F;babur.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;400&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;img&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Nauroz va naubahar va ma’i&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Va dilbari khusht&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Babur ba”aish kush ki&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alam dobara na ast&quot;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;( &lt;em&gt;the new year, the spring&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The wine and the beloved are pleasing&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;O Babur enjoy them&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For the world is not to be had a second time&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>MX Linux is a really good distro</title>

          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/thingsthatmakemxlinuxagooddistro/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/thingsthatmakemxlinuxagooddistro/">&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m currently daily driving MX Linux. In Debian side of the world, in my experience, I have found MX Linux to be a fair alternative to Ubuntu. It is actually a really good distro, and I have some points to back my statement:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1- According to MX Linux&#x27;s developers it&#x27;s a user-oriented distribution. Which means it includes some non-free software in it by default in order to make this distro &#x27;work out of the box&#x27; without giving the user much trouble. These non-free software may include fonts, media codecs, browsers etc. for example, in &#x27;MX package package installer&#x27; user has the ability to download google-chrome&#x2F;edge etc.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2- If you have only used Fedora and opensuse your entire life, you would find the installation time of MX Linux to be magical. I have found the MX Installer to be 3 times faster than Ubuntu&#x27;s installer. MX use its custom installer which has enough options and is fast at the same time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3- If you are one of those people who don&#x27;t like the idea of systemd then you would feel at home to find that MX comes with there own init system by default. Which is, of course faster than systemd.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4- If you are one of those people who LIKE the idea of systemd then you would feel at home to find that MX linux has a systemd option which you can enable from MX Boot options or from the boot screen. It shows that MX is not just another &#x27;I hate systemd distro&#x27;, It is a user-oriented distro, if a user wants to run some applications which are only available under systemd then user has the ability to switch over to systemd without going full hacker mode. Apart from that I&#x27;ve found systemd on mX to work faster than on most distros. Boot time difference between Ubuntu and MX (systemd) is big.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5- Now comes MX tools. MX tools is like Yast on Debian. I like to do things on command line but after using MX tools I&#x27;ve found that sometimes GUI things can also save lot of time. For example, to block advertisement URLs I can manually go to github, copy all the URLs and add them to my host file. But hey, I can achieve the same with MX ad blocker tool with just few clicks! ad block is just one of them, with MX tools you can take system snapshot and can create your custom iso, can fix your boot problems, clean your system by deleting junk files, edit your bash config, install codes and even you can install Nvidia drivers!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6- You won&#x27;t be told to RTFM everytime you ask for help on MX forum. Even the developers will come out to solve your problem as soon as possible. Now some Arch users may not like the idea of the outright help but see not everybody has time and willingness to RTFM everytime something breaks in their system. of-course you learn things by RTFM but if you work 12 hour shift 6 days a week then I don&#x27;t think that reading the manual makes much sense.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7- MX Linus is a light weight distro. IT comes with xfce and kde, both are light on resources plus the boot time on MX are fast. It has for certainly given life to my crapy hardware. Even on their website it is said that MX was designed while keeping the old hardware in mind. And despite being lightweight MX comes with tons customization of options, even more than what you can find on some of the resource hog distros. On old or weak hardware MX is a must try.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These were some of the points why I consider MX Linux to be a really good disro. If you haven&#x27;t then do give MX a try, don&#x27;t just get off by the initial looks it&#x27;s highly customizable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post was proudly written on vim running on MX Linux.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>You hate NFTs? so cute</title>
          <pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

          <link>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/you-hate-nft-so-cute/</link>
          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/you-hate-nft-so-cute/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/you-hate-nft-so-cute/">&lt;p&gt;We make fun of NFTs. And the people who buy NFTs are considered merely to be memes by the majority of us at this point. however, looking at NFTs from the business perspective does make lot of sense. NFTs are profitable, that is why many companies who have sold only physical goods from the dawn of their time are now doing heavy investment in selling virtual goods. Some of the luxury brands who are expanding their business to metaverse include Balenciaga, Gucci and Nike (Is Nike luxury? yes come visit the third world)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;virtual-commodities-are-profitable&quot;&gt;Virtual commodities are profitable&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a fun fact: Some consumers are willing to pay much more for a virtual commodity than the same physical counterpart. Expensive game skins...people buy them. Even some ugly looking NFTs are being sold for millions! matter of the fact is people are willing to pay higher prices for virtual commodities, and it attracts investment from companies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After price, lets see the cost of producing virtual commodities. The cost of producing a game skin or some NFT of monkey&#x27;s picture is far less than producing a physical commodity. Now show me one business which doesn&#x27;t like to reduce its cost of producing goods.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of cost, there is a big cost which takes a big chunk of profit from our poor multimillionaire companies i.e cost of keeping the inventory. In order to store physical commodity business must build warehouse, hire people, spend money and time on security etc. now how much money do you have spend to store virtual goods? compared to physical goods? NUFFIN!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, Price of virtual commodities is high, cost is low and profit is insane. Virtual commodity is sugar, business is ant, and the profit is sweetness.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;you-don-t-like-virtual-commodities-nfts-so-cute&quot;&gt;You don&#x27;t like virtual commodities&#x2F;NFTs? so cute.&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now we(majority) make fun of buying virtual commodities&#x2F;NFTs but you know what....businesses don&#x27;t care about us.(majority) They don&#x27;t care about your dislike of NFTs. They care about the people who buy them. See this if there are 1000 men on internet. (there are no real girls on internet only Russian bots) Out of these 1000 men, 950 hate buying virtual goods and only 50 men like to buy them. The thing to take in consideration here is that these 50 men (minority) are the molders of the internet not the 950 men (majority).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we know in market we vote by our money. In the example above we see that minority votes for the future of internet. Majority which hates to buy virtual goods does not vote. They don&#x27;t have the voter id card. They don&#x27;t participate in decision making.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering the amount of profit in selling virtual goods. Companies will shape the internet in such a way to facilitate the market for virtual goods&#x2F; NFTs. Internet is no more just a market place, its an whole economy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are domain names virtual goods? Oh my....I became the same thing i swore to destroy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Buy Now Pay Later</title>
          <pubDate>Mon, 20 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
          <author>Unknown</author>
          <link>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/buy-now-pay-later/</link>
          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/buy-now-pay-later/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/buy-now-pay-later/">&lt;p&gt;Lately I&#x27;ve been getting lot of calls from my bank telling me to get a free credit card. Not only my bank but also the banks in which i don&#x27;t even have account are also offering me free credit card. And not only banks but also some new fancy companies have approached me for interest free virtual credit card.  For a moment i thought my country is turning into some welfare state where they are lending money to poor people for free. It happens often times in free market economy that the marketing department pitch the deal in such a way that it sounds like the company is literally giving stuff for free. They make it sound like the company doesn&#x27;t exist for profit motive but solely for social welfare.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially i didn&#x27;t thought much about it, but few days ago, i watched a BBC documentary on free credit providers. It turns out that the reason these companies don&#x27;t charge interest from the consumers is that the people who buy goods on credit are not the costumers of these credit companies but they are the product. The real costumers are the sellers. (Amazon etc.) So basically what these credit companies do is that they go to sellers (Amazon etc.) and pitch them something like this : &quot;Hey ecommerce website, see this x research which is conducted by y university, it shows that when sellers provide interest free credit to their costumers, it increases their sales by 20%. We can help you in increasing your sales. we will provide interest free credit to your costumers and for that you only have to pay us 5% on every sale made through our credit service.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ecommerce platform: &quot;Nice!&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to be a win win situation for everyone at first sight. Consumers are happy that they are getting credit without interest, Sellers are happy that their sales are increasing, credit companies are happy that they are getting money from retailers.(or ecommerce platforms) umm...but, aren&#x27;t we missing something?....two things, we are missing two things. If we miss these two things we fail to see the suffering which is hiding in the plain sight.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-who-is-going-to-pay-for-increased-cost&quot;&gt;1) Who is going to pay for increased cost?&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes free credit service increases the sales numbers. But what&#x27;s the point of higher sales when new cost are also increased? In this case, To increase their sales the retailers (or ecommerce platforms) have to pay certain percentage of price to the credit companies. Technically, in this case these ecommerce platforms are paying the interest charges to credit companies on the behalf of its costumers. Now here you don&#x27;t have to be a professional economist to see that in long run, due to heavy competition profit margin will be reduced to the minimum (average profit) and if ecommerce platforms continue to bear interest charges on the behalf of its consumers they will go out of business. So eventually, to protect themselves from losses the ecommerce platforms will increase the price of their products.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A time will come when the cost of interest (or the commission which retailers have to pay to credit companies) will be seen as a natural cost of producing the product and will be added to the price of every product. People will think that they are getting free credit but little would they know that the interest charges are already added to the price of product.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-who-would-suffer-the-most&quot;&gt;2) Who would suffer the most?&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who don&#x27;t like to be in-debt. The people who think that debt is evil, will suffer the most. How? As we already saw that the cost of interest will eventually be added to the general prices of the commodities. Hence the people who won&#x27;t buy on debt will still be paying for the interest cost. Not all people will buy on credit but certainly the cost of interest will be distributed equally to every consumer irrespective of their payment method.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;who-will-win&quot;&gt;Who will win?&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets imagine if there are 100 consumers in future, 60 of them buy goods on interest free credit, 40 (boomers) buy with cash. And the ecommerce platform is paying $1000 as commission to interest free credit providers &amp;gt; ecommerce platform adds this cost in the price of product &amp;gt; the new cost is distributed equally to each consumer &amp;gt; people who buy things on cash will also be paying for interest cost &amp;gt; as a result people who buy things on credit will be paying less than the actual interest charges they would have been paying otherwise.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who buy things on credit will be the only winners in the long run. Ecommerce platforms and credit providers will only earn average revenue (no profit no loss). And people who refuse to buy things on credit will be the real losers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Living In The Simulation Paradise</title>
          <pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
          <author>Unknown</author>
          <link>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/living-in-the-simulation-paradise/</link>
          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/living-in-the-simulation-paradise/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/living-in-the-simulation-paradise/">&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we are living in a simulation. What if we all are just some characters in a video game, In which all the decisions which we think that we make (Deciding to drink water or choosing partner) are actually not made by us but by the person who is playing the video game. or maybe the simulation code from which our universe is made makes all the decisions. What if all the laws of nature are just the laws of a simulation code. 
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my favourite conspiracy theory. Even &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xBKRuI2zHp0&quot;  target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Elon Musk&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=pmcrG7ZZKUc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; Neil deGrasse Tyson&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; believe that we might be living in a computer program. and you might also have some belief in this too. but unfortunately for us being just some video game characters it is impossible for us to know that if we are living in a simulated reality or not. This world is our reality, This code is our world. With our senses we can only experience this code.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person who created this world, for the sake of this argument, lets call him God. And the problem with god is that we have not seen him. And god is the only being who knows whether our world simulated or not. When we have never met god how can we ask him this question?
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only solution left to us is matrix. We must enquire that can we make a simulated reality in which a person&#x27;s body can still be in Delhi but his mind will be transferred to some other reality? If that can be done, we can conclude that if we can create a simulated reality then why can&#x27;t god too. and this will increase the chances of us living in a simulated reality from zero. One good thing here is that we have already reached a time where different realities are already being created. While consuming these simulated realities man only exists physically in this world but his mind is in different reality.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Before we go further let us just understand what we mean by reality here:
&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To experience our world we use our senses. what we See, Touch, Smell, Taste constitutes our reality. For example, Bulls can&#x27;t see the colour red, hence in their reality red doesn&#x27;t exist. Only the colours a Bull can see are real for him. At this moment lets divide reality into two parts first, Real Real (real truth) and second Perceived Real (what we think is real) 
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first real, Real Real (real truth) doesn&#x27;t care if we know about it or not. It exist outside us and is independent form us. from example Black Holes in space still existed in space even when we didn&#x27;t know anything about them and they still continue to exist even after humans got to know that they exist.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second real, Perceived Real, is inside us and totally dependent on our senses. For us red colour exist is our Perceived Real but for Bull red colour doesn&#x27;t exist as he can&#x27;t see it that&#x27;s why the colour Red doesn&#x27;t constitute his Perceived Real. Perceived Real is much more stronger for us than Real Real (real truth) as it is only through our Perceived Real that we make our decisions. What if god exist and he is standing right next to you but like Bull who is colour blind, you are god blind and can&#x27;t see god. If it weren&#x27;t for our god blindness, this thousands of years old debate on existence of god wouldn&#x27;t have existed. (Sadiyon se yeh behas chalti rahi, par bhagwaan ki baat jahan thi wahi atki rahi!)
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our senses can be fooled, our perceived truth can be fooled. By fooling our senses a simulated world can be created where a person will loose all its touch form Real Real (the real truth) and enter into an  illusionary simulation. And for a person who&#x27;s living in illusionary simulation, real truth doesn&#x27;t matter anymore. for him illusionary simulation is new real. lets see how with current technology we are creating bits of illusionary perceived real. step by step we will see how every single one of senses can be fooled. and finally we will see how a time will come when we will completely loose our touch with current reality and will enter in a simulated one.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fooling our senses with technology:
&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eyes:&lt;&#x2F;b&gt; TV screens are good examples of creating small simulations&#x2F;matrix. Pictures shown on TV screens are like phantoms i.e half present half absent. What i mean by that is the characters in movies and TV serials are fictional however they still have impact on real lives. For example Indian women knew that their favourite character in &#x27;Saas Bahu&#x27; serial is fictional but still these women cried when their favourite character slept hungry. And why only these women we all must have cried sometime watching an emotional scene. We cry even though we know its fake. We know its fake but we still don&#x27;t know its fake. Its like our brain can&#x27;t distinguish between women sleeping hungry on a screen and a women sleeping hungry in front of your house. And why shouldn&#x27;t our brain believe whatever it sees in TV screen? for millions of years our brain has gone through evolution to see reality through eyes. TV screens are new, it won&#x27;t be that easy for our brains to distinguish between the picture shown on TV screen and life outside it. For our brain both are reality.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ear:&lt;&#x2F;b&gt; Music! similar to TV screens, our brains can&#x27;t distinguish between what it listens on earphone from what it listen from its real surroundings. Even a weak man can feel powerful by listening to &#x27;Dance of the nights&#x27;. will write more on EVIL effects of music on us in next article.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Skin:&lt;&#x2F;b&gt; Yes, by using devices which give &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=uPnHzQ7qJ2Y&quot;  target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Haptic feedback.&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; one can get the feeling of simulated touch. Another example can be seen in pilot training, in order to reduce the cost involved in setting up a full size cockpit mockup, a device which gives haptic feedback is used to &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;pilot-training-simulator-vr-haptic-touch&#x2F;&quot;  target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;train pilots.&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=..&#x2F;pix&#x2F;290921&#x2F;haptics.jpeg&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;..&#x2F;pix&#x2F;290921&#x2F;haptics.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Haptics Feedback&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;center&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Smell:&lt;&#x2F;b&gt; Yes electronically generated fake smell does &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;GLvqk8Hmcqs&quot;  target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; exist.&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Taste:&lt;&#x2F;b&gt; Yes, electronically generated taste does &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=sSJ63KXyMqU&quot;  target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;exist&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to fool your body in believing that one is really eating something. With this device you just have to stick your tongue with a plugged in circuit board and that&#x27;s it you can now taste electronically generated Sweetness, Sourness or Bitterness.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Creating matrix paradise with VR sets
&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=&#x2F;pix&#x2F;290921&#x2F;senpai.jpeg&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;&#x2F;pix&#x2F;290921&#x2F;senpai.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;senpai&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously we saw how TV creates matrix by fooling our Eyes and how music fools our Ears and so on. But their limitation is that they are only able to form a partial matrix as they only exploit one or two senses. They are not able to form complete matrix where a person can loose his complete touch with reality. A successful matrix can only be the one where a person looses his complete touch with reality and enter into simulation. In a full matrix, simulation must become a complete Perceived Real. Here I&#x27;m optimistic with VR technology. It combines all the small matrix (screen, sound etc.) to create a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;img-9gag-fun.9cache.com&#x2F;photo&#x2F;aGpm930_460svav1.mp4&quot;  target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;full matrix.&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; See &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=eS43PEn7lEE&quot;  target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;this&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; funny example from the Onion, here except smell (and taste. but do you need taste for that?) the person enters into a matrix. &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=LH8bMx66bfY&quot;  target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;these&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; are some other funny examples which shows how one looses touch with reality and enter into matrix by using VR. Even after its success i believe it will at least two decades for VR technology to create a real matrix. and a time will come where we humans will spend most of our lives living in a full matrix, something similar to the Matrix movie.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Ban In India</title>
          <pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/ban-in-india/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/ban-in-india/">&lt;p&gt;To protect the easily exploitable consumers our Govt. banned Tiktok. Now it seems to be the turn of cryptocurrencies. Arguments are being made by people in defence of crypto currency ban. But as things are not yet quite clear in the bill. We are left with speculations and arguments. Just banning cryptocurrency doesn&#x27;t seems to be a viable solution.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One argument is that there are just too many cryptocurrencies, but in order to become money (As a medium of exchange) uniformity is a necessity. Yes, this is true however in long run this argument is irrelevant because we know, Monopoly is the end of competition. Mr. Raghuram Rajan said &quot;Out of 6000 odd cryptocurrencies only one or two best will survive.&quot; Here we can learn from history that even in barter system, initially, there was lot of competition but in long run gold and silver came out as clear winners. we won&#x27;t be wrong predicting the same for cryptocurrencies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another argument made is that the average investor in India is 24 years old, first time investor who is being lured by false higher rewards shown in the advertisements of crypto trading companies. As a natural consequence of this, Indian investors loose money, the lost money then goes out of India and reduces our currency reserves. Well, we all know at least one person who falls under this category. Unfortunately, there are (lot of) people in India who are an easy prey for crypto currency propaganda.(Advertisement) This is a chief argument made for crypto ban. But if we move our heads a bit we can see a similar phenomenon happening. The same 24 year old ignorant guy who is putting his money in cryptocurrency without understanding how it works is also investing in stock market without being able to even read a balance sheet. If cryptocurrency is being banned because average Indian investor is ignorant and easily exploitable then by this logic stock market should also be banned. Here i guess ban is not a viable solution to protect the ignorant and easily exploitable masses but our government must take stand to educate our investors so that they are able to make rational decisions. As the saying goes &quot;Dear God don&#x27;t give us easy circumstances but make us strong enough so that we can conquer even the tough ones.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;argument that banning foreign crypto giants will help our Indian home grown cryptos. Yes, it will help our &#x27;Made in India&#x27; cryptos, but for how long? lets imagine its 2040 and we have been successful at keeping foreign cryptocurrencies at bay. As we already know by that time there will be only one or two cryptocurrencies which will have a substantial global share in being used as a medium of exchange. At that point India will encounter two major problems: first, Indians won&#x27;t be able make international payments as in 2040 Indians won&#x27;t have reserves of the internationally standardized cryptocurrencies because they are banned in India. Secondly, if India at that point decides to open its markets for foreign cryptocurrencies, it will most probably disrupt the then established crypto market. If markets are opened in 2040 Indians may give higher preference to the currencies which are by then were able to establish themselves as international standard. As a result Indian crypto companies will suffer the most. In this way the time taken to open boarders for cryptocurrencies will be directly proportional to its consequences on Indians and Indian crypto currencies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now comes the argument that because of the secure nature of cryptocurrencies it may be used by terrorists. As lot has already been said by others to counter this argument, i will try to protect myself from repeating them. But i would still say that evil or good nature of any technology strictly depends on the hands who use them. A knife can be used to cut an apple or cut a throat. Then ban knife too? If we ban all the technology which can be used by evil hands then wouldn&#x27;t India go back to stone age? (Even stones can also be used to harm others, ban them too?)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our respected experts at RBI have done their research and they have come up with a plan to regulate the cryptocurrency market. But until we see this bill in execution we won&#x27;t be able to see its real implications. Most of the arguments which are given seems to be unprepared excuses which hides the fact that the predominant reason for the ban is to keep in control the supply of medium of exchange in the country. Least we can do is to hope for the regulations to be liberal enough to prevent the unnecessary losses.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Future Zucks Bro</title>
          <pubDate>Sun, 21 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/future-zucks-bro/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/future-zucks-bro/">&lt;p&gt;Everyone on internet has been talking about Meta and Metaverse since its idea was proposed by Zuckerberg. I think the general opinion of people on internet can be summerised this way: &quot;The idea of metaverse looks like something from black mirror. Everyone knows its bad hence its just another bad decision made by Facebook.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do agree with the first part that the idea of Meta does look like something from black mirror and is depressing. however, as far as second part is concerned, i think, Facebook actually made a right decision. At this point metaverse IS inevitable And most of the people who are criticizing Facebook WILL be in metaverse.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-metaverse-is-inevitable&quot;&gt;Why Metaverse is Inevitable&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember reading an essay where the author claimed that when a species becomes more advanced it tends to focus its attention on finding shortcuts. What kind of shortcuts? We humans have reached a stage where we focus much of our attention on achieving things virtually rather than in real life. Why virtually? Because its easier. I quote : &quot;Technology is fairly good at controlling external external reality to promote real biological fitness, but its even better at delivering fake fitness - subjective cues of survival and reproduction without real-world effects&quot; further he says &quot;...I think that aliens forget to send radio signals or colonise space because they&#x27;re too busy with runaway consumerism and virtual reality narcissism. Once they turn inwards to chase their shiny pennies of pleasure, they loose the cosmic plot&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the reason why i think metaverse is inevitable. Metaverse is the next step of the &#x27;shortcuts&#x27; we create to make our lives easier. Want to go to Switzerland but you are an average wage earner from a third world country? No problem! just buy this affordable meta VR set, download&#x2F;stream this Switzerland program and within minutes you are in Switzerland. (virtually) Isn&#x27;t it a good shortcut? Traditionally, you would have to earn a lot of money to travel in Switzerland but now (lets say 2027) you can get it cheaply without leaving your parent&#x27;s basement!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for us internet is not new. We know enough history of internet that we can see patterns to predict future. I agree with Zuck when he said &quot;Our (consumer&#x27;s) internet consumption has moved from &#x27;text&#x27; in its early stages to pictures to now videos (Tiktok, Insta-stories...) and future&#x27;s consumer demands a metaverse&quot; Metaverse is inevitable if Facebook doesn&#x27;t do it someone else will. Internet is fast and it is getting faster day by day, companies like facebook are investing lots of money into making equipment for metaverse, people want to engage more with VR. In other words consumers are willing to buy metaverse, companies are willing to sell metaverse and infrastructure is willing to support metaverse. Hence it is inevitable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;going-back-to-2004&quot;&gt;Going Back to 2004&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would have happened if Zuckerberg in 2004 had made a similar announcement for Facebook what he made for meta?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuckerberg: &quot;umm..Yeah so..we got internet but we&#x27;re still kinda unconnected so I&#x27;m gonna launch Facebook a social media website by which people would be able to connect with each other, share their birthday pictures with friends, can send messages, if you are a seller you can sell products. Basically the possibilities are limitless&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People: &quot;OMG! its so frightening! we would be able to send each other messages but you know what this dude will own the platform so his company would be able to read those messages. And no I&#x27;m never gonna share my private birthday memories with people on internet. What do you mean by sellers can sell their products on internet? they would be able to target advertising and sell me the things that i don&#x27;t want to buy! No this idea is clearly stupid no one is ever gonna use your authoritative platform. No one will!&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what actually happened? in 2021 there are approx 2.8 billion Facebook users. If Facebook is bad than no one should use it right?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;democrazy&quot;&gt;Democrazy&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its a well known fact that Facebook (company) is a privacy nightmare but still its users are constantly increasing. Generally it seems like convenience overpowers common sense. Few idiots who get pissed off by the privacy policies of these social media platforms make their own websites to share their based articles. (Bascially these pople focus their attention on finding alternatives) VERY few saints leave internet altogether. However, free market is like democracy which is ruled by majority not by minority. Majority on internet needs convenience, hence ignorant convenience rules the internet. Metaverse seems to be a really convenient thing. Despite the consequences of metaverse i think, people will still vote (use) for its rule. Sure a minority of outlaws will always exist with their self hosted alternatives but they will never be able to become a member of Internet&#x27;s parliament.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;don-t-be-a-luke-smith&quot;&gt;Don&#x27;t be a Luke Smith&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke Smith is the reason why i have my personal website. And I&#x27;m not alone, there are many people who are influenced by Luke. But one critique of Luke is that he seems to be in an irrelevant war against social media. He is focusing too much on finding alternatives. Do you really need a self hosted &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=oOiCACmjKBM&quot;&gt;twitter alternative&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;? Twitter is a disease. When you are suffering from a disease, you don&#x27;t find it&#x27;s alternatives you get rid of it altogether.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Luke says: &quot;Host Mestadon and free yourself from corporate owned twitter&quot;
What i hear: &quot;host your own cancer to free yourself from corporate owned cancer&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What i&#x27;m trying to say is when metaverse will become a normal thing maybe lets say in 2028, it would be better to not to host your own metaverse or find alternatives but to rather leave metaverse altogether.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke Smith in 2028:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#x2F;pix&#x2F;luke2028.jpg&gt;&lt;img class=resmid src=&quot;&#x2F;pix&#x2F;luke2028.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;luke&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Zuck made a right decision by focusing his companies focus on metverse. The reason he was able to make such an prediction for future is that now we know a thing or two about the history of internet and connecting dots leads nowhere but to metaverse. It seems metaverse industry is inevitable. And Zuck&#x27;s willingness to be an early bird in this industry might beneficial for Facebook (Meta) that&#x27;s why i think future Zucks bro!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Cool trick to install software via apt package manager</title>
          <pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/cool-trick-to-install-software-via-apt-package-manager/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/cool-trick-to-install-software-via-apt-package-manager/">&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
to install software via apt in debian and debian based distros you have to type &quot;sudo apt install foo&quot; however there are two problems with this:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
1- you have to know the exact name of the package you want to install
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2- you have to type &quot;sudo apt install foo&quot; which is somewhat long.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
there is a cool trick which someone posted on reddit.(and i can&#x27;t remember the exact source at this moment)
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;paste this code in terminal:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;code&gt; apt-cache search &quot;&quot; | sort | cut --delimiter &quot; &quot; --fields 1 | fzf --multi --cycle --reverse --preview &quot;apt-cache show {1}&quot; --preview-window=:57%:wrap:rounded:hidden --bind=space:toggle-preview | xargs -r sudo apt install -y &lt;&#x2F;code&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;a href=&#x2F;pix&#x2F;fapt.png&gt;&lt;img class=resmid src=&quot;&#x2F;pix&#x2F;fapt.png&quot; alt=&quot;fapt&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;br&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(ofcourse you can make a simple script or make alias of this big command to make it short)
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
technically he just added apt repository with fuzzy finder, but no one had ever thought of doing this simple thing, and that&#x27;s why i&#x27;m thankful to the guy who originally posted this on reddit.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
prerequisite:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
you should have fzf installed in order to use it.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;body&gt;

          <description xml:base="https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/melophile-society-and-its-future/">&lt;p&gt;The Musical Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for human race. Gone are the days of sophisticated lyrics and good voice. Junk lyrics with auto-tune voice is ruling the music market. This is the music revolution. You might find me ranting about these new age songs here but this is also true that there are way more people who intoxicate themselves with these type of junk songs as compared to the people who enjoy good old songs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally we listen to music for its ability to give pleasure to our mind. As consuming music activates same part of brain similar to what is activated by eating food and taking &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newsweek.com&#x2F;music-produces-pleasure-similarly-drugs-and-sex-553946&quot;&gt;drugs&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Not only for pleasure we might also consume music to escape from reality or just for nostalgia. Listing to music for escape from reality is enough to make one restrain from indulging too much into music. Apart from that the quality of music we consume is also degrading. Lets see in coming paragraph how.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#x2F;pix&#x2F;doomermusic.jpg&gt;&lt;img class=resmid src=&quot;&#x2F;pix&#x2F;doomermusic.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;doomer&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;empty-calories-it-sounds-good-but-the-lyrics-are-meaningless&quot;&gt;Empty Calories (It sounds good but the lyrics are meaningless)&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember the song from your grandfather&#x27;s time &quot;Rote hue aate hain sab hasta hua jo jayega wo...&quot; or from your father&#x27;s time &quot;duniya mane bura to goli maro, dar ke jeena bhi koi jeena yaaro?&quot; and what do you have the young of 2021? &quot;Diladu Ghar chandigarh mai...&quot; and &quot;coca cola tu, sona sona tu, coca cola tu, sona sona tu....&quot; (For the ones from English speaking countries, remember the lyrics of The Gambler Song? and compare it with 6ix9ine&#x27;s &quot;Niggas act dumb when i act dumb-dumb tell &#x27;em don&#x27;t act dumb coz I&#x27;m dumber&quot;) Don&#x27;t you think over the years the quality of lyrics have reduced down to just being junk? Its quite normal these days, for a junk song to hit the trending list. But it was difficult, two decades ago for a junk song to achieve the same. The question is what is the difference now that junk songs are getting all the popularity? I think the reason lies in the MUSIC used in the songs. The music which is being used now a days in songs is much more stimulating than what it was 2 or 3 decades ago. Now with the help of technology artificial stimulative sounds can be created which are nonexistent in old songs which used real instruments to produce sounds. As a result of all this the songs now a days have become much more stimulating, because the focus is more on the music rather than lyrics the quality of lyrics has come down. And why not? People are listening songs for pleasure or escape and for these reasons they need more stimulating things which are being provided by the artificial music. This is similar to eating junk food.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the junk food which tastes good but does not have anything healthy in it. The same way it is with modern music. The taste of Junk Food hides its emptiness. The taste alone hides its poor nutrition value. When eating Fast Food people forget about the nutrition value and only focus on its taste. If you ask an American to choose between a McDonald&#x27;s Burger and a Banana, he would probably choose the Burger even though it will have bad impact on his health. As a rule of thumb you can make people eat shit if you add enough spices in it. People will be happy to eat shit as long as it will taste good. And if for some reason you tell them that what they are eating is just a shit camouflaged by spices and cheese, people will boycott you.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the similar way it is with modern music. On the surface the new songs are much more stimulating and sounds good but deep down they are just a shit camouflaged by artificial stimulative music.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;lenin-on-music&quot;&gt;Lenin on Music&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes..yes..he killed 20 Gazillion people in Soviet Russia, so what? For a moment lets forget his political sins and see what he has to say on music. Maybe we will learn something from it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;But often I can’t listen to music. It acts on my nerves. It makes one want to
say a lot of sweet nonsense and stroke the heads of people who live in a
filthy hell-hole and yet can create such beauty. But you can’t stroke
anyone’s head today – you’ll get your hands cut off. The need is to beat
them over the head, beat them mercilessly even though we, as an ideal, are
against any coercion of people. Hm, hm ... it’s a hellishly difficult
necessity.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Review of Various Linux Distros</title>
          <pubDate>Sun, 24 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
          <author>Unknown</author>
          <link>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/review-of-various-linux-distros/</link>
          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/review-of-various-linux-distros/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/review-of-various-linux-distros/">&lt;p&gt;If we go to Distrowatch we can find that there are hundreds of Linux distros listed there but at the end we can see that most of those Linux distros are more or less themed versions of three major Linux distributions i.e Arch, Debian and Fedora. Reviewing all of the distributions available on Distrowatch is not only time consuming but also irrelevant. Hence i will restrict myself with reviewing only the ones which i think are relevant.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;arch&quot;&gt;Arch&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arch is a rolling-release Distro which means whenever a new version of a package is released Arch users get it through instant updates. In Arch Linux, there are lot of updates, updates everywhere! Arch users are the first ones to get latest software in Linux world, but they are also the first ones to encounter the bugs. One thing which comes to the mind of many users when they start to use Arch is that they should&#x27;ve listened to the memes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although in official repository, Arch has less packages availability than that of Debian. However to compensate that arch has its &#x27;Arch User Repository&#x27; (AUR) where the arch users submit the software compiled by them. Personally I&#x27;ve found that every proprietary software which is made to work on Linux is available in AUR. This is a big selling point of Arch Linux, you don&#x27;t have to go on different websites to download .deb and .rpm in order to install software on your machine. On Arch, for example if you want to install brave browser you just need to type &lt;code&gt;yay -S brave-bin&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and that&#x27;s it Brave will be installed on your system. Contrary to that if you were using a Debian based distribution you would have to go through 3-4 step process to install brave!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;debian&quot;&gt;Debian&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debian has three release models i.e Stable, Testing  and Unstable. However according to Debian&#x27;s website only stable is recommended for general use. Debian developers use Testing and Unstable as the testing ground for Stable. But still you can find many Debian Unstable users on internet who claim that their distro does not break. Debian has the highest number of packages in its repositories, more than double than that of Arch&#x27;s but you won&#x27;t be able to find those proprietary software in Debian&#x27;s repository which are available in AUR. When used on workstations Debian Stable is criticised for having obsolete packages. It is understandable for Debian after one year of its release to have older packages but even the new release lags behind 5 months of development. It has its own use case, on server you don&#x27;t usually want your disto to be a rolling-release, on servers debian comes to your help. But still there are lot of people who don&#x27;t care what version number they are using. These people use Debian stable as their daily driver and are happy with it. I consider myself of this category however my love with Debian is only one sided, Debian refuses to boot on my hardware even though i used iso with non-free drivers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;fedora&quot;&gt;Fedora&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m not sure about the release cycle of Fedora. It&#x27;s not a complete rolling-release nor its a stable release. Some parts of Fedora gets all kind of updates on the other hand some just get security fixes. Although a new version of fedora comes every six months.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve two major concerns about Fedora. First, it is usually the fist distro to adopt a new technology. Fedora was the first distro to use wayland. Now wayland has made the Linux experience much more smoother however when it first came, in its early stage, wayland was giving much problems. Too much ram usage, applications not supporting wayland were some of the many problems which were associated with wayland in its early stage and as Fedora was using wayland, all its users were suffering because of it. Wayland is only one example of many new technologies which were adopted by Fedora before anyone else did. As desktop users we must know that Fedora is a testing ground for red hat. Hence it is not the best thing to be used on personal computers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the package manager used by Fedora: DNF, it is slooooow! DNF automatically updates its repository everytime user wants to install a package. This sounds good on paper however the update of repository takes longer on fedora as compared to that of Debian. Which makes it troublesome to install or perform basic tasks with packages in Fedora terminal.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ubuntu&quot;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu is the windows of Linux world. It is the most hated one. But still i think in consumer market Ubuntu has played the biggest role in the success of Linux. Linux would have only being using by nerds in their parent&#x27;s basements if it was not for Ubuntu. On the surface you can say Ubuntu is based on Debian, but can you really recommend a new user to use Debian? That is the work done by Ubuntu devs to make &#x27;Linux for humans&#x27;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes there are some genuine concerns about ubuntu for example snaps etc. but hey, no one is forcing you to stick with ubuntu, now its no more 2010. Other distros have matured in providing a good consumer experience, just move to them if you don&#x27;t like snaps and the direction in which ubuntu is moving.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Critique of Luke Smith&#x27;s Freedom</title>

          <description xml:base="https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/critique-of-luke-smith-s-freedom/">&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in his recent &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lukesmith.xyz&#x2F;articles&#x2F;modern-freedom-means-being-a-slave-to-impulses&quot;&gt;work&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; Luke smith, while explaining freedom, writes:&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&quot;Christians stated the classical view of freedom very clearly. Paul writes that all men are either &quot;slaves to Christ&quot; or &quot;slaves to sin.&quot; The modern man wants to retort that he does&#x27;t want to be a slave to anything, but wants to be his own master, but there is really no such thing.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can be guided by Christ, or more generally, by consistent moral principles, restraint and forethought. Or one can abandon the pretense of morality and by definition follow his impulses to fornication, substance-abuse, and general reckless living. &quot;
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it is clear from his work that, what Luke is trying to say here is: man is either first,a slave of god or second, a slave of impulses. and there is no middle ground i.e man is not free. man can&#x27;t think for himself. man needs a master to tell him what to do. 
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in first case, god tells man what good things man has to do to get emancipation from the evil.(the problem here is that there is not only one god in this world, but multiple. who have mostly contradictory rules of do&#x27;s and don&#x27;t&#x27;s) for example a Hindu will listen to his god and will not harm the weak, don&#x27;t act cowardly, perform his responsibilities and so on.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in the second case, instead of listing to god. man becomes rebellious, denies the existence of god. and sets the belief of listing to himself. but according to Luke, man is slave to his impulses hence he only listens to his impulses. for example doing drugs, checking social media every 5 minutes, being watching movies and so on. the point here is that man thinks he is free but he is slave to his impulses.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;unfortunately Luke the unaboomer is wrong.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p class=sub&gt;man is not just impulses
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i say Luke only finds fault in man only to give himself reason to do slavery of god. when Luke says man is slave to his impulses, he only sees the animal part of the man. man is more than just impulses. man is a conscious being. who can think. who can decide. who can act rationally. animal on the other hand are the real slaves of impulses. eat, sleep, reproduce is what all they think but man is different from them. man is an animal who can think. but according to Luke man is only an animal i.e a slave to impulses.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as karl marx wrote:&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&quot;The animal is immediately one with its life activity. It does not distinguish itself from it. It is its life activity. Man makes his life activity itself the object of his will and of his consciousness. He has conscious life activity. It is not a determination with which he directly merges. Conscious life activity distinguishes man immediately from animal life activity. It is just because of this that he is a species-being. Or it is only because he is a species-being that he is a conscious being, i.e., that his own life is an object for him. Only because of that is his activity free activity.&quot;
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if man is just a slave to impulses then why not all people watch t.v. 10 hours a day? there are always some addict who do watch t.v. 10 hours a day but most of us don&#x27;t. because we can think. we can think it&#x27;s unhealthy and there are other responsibilities which are need to be fulfilled. but if we follow Luke&#x27;s idea and see man as just a slave of impulses everyone should be watching t.v. 10 hours a day. which is wrong.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p class=sub&gt;does religion gives all the answers?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;multiple religions with different philosophies. often contradictory. then how do you decide which one to follow? or which one is right? the debate on these questions are continuing from the dawn of the time but no one has found a compelling answer. 
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;can Luke smith&#x27;s bible tell how much hours of internet consumption is good and how much is evil?
can Luke smith&#x27;s bible tell how much McDonald consumption is good and how much is evil?
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yes the exact answers to these questions can not be found in religious books. that&#x27;s where human thinking comes. man thinks how much consumption is good and how much is unhealthy.man does not need religion to answer these and other question. it&#x27;s common sense.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the why even bother doing slavery of god when man can take control of his impulses by just thinking?
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;perhaps Luke smith answer this question by saying &quot;going to church is cool&quot; or &quot;all the cool kids are religious&quot; and so on. Luke smith is the kind of guy who would do slavery just to look cool on internet.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p class=sub&gt;the real solution to get freedom: take responsibility and be free
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a kid is a slave to his parents. in the sense that he has to eat and do what his parents decide. because he is not mature enough to think for himself. but as he grows, he starts to think, makes decisions, and he is also held accountable for his actions. his parents gives him more freedom to decide what&#x27;s better for him. for example giving him the freedom to decide his course in college etc. and that kid gets complete freedom when he starts to earn money. now his parents no more tell him what to eat and what not to. if he in his adult age eat chocolate all the time it&#x27;s he who is responsible for his ill health. but now as he is adult and knows all the ill effects of eating too much chocolate he no more eats them. he is free to decide. but taking right decisions is his responsibility. if he can not take right decisions. his freedom must be taken back. doctors will force him to stick to healthy diet. the moment he fails to take responsibility he looses his freedom.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hence taking responsibility is the only way to get freedom.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when stuck in problem, take responsibility and find solution. and if the solution does&#x27;t work, take responsibility of your failure. only in this way freedom can be achieved.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;finally,
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1- a man who is slave to his impulses is not a man but animal and should be called one.&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
2- being slave to god is better than being slave to impulses. but still not free yet.&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
3- thinking,making decisions, taking responsibility of your actions is true freedom. this is what distinguishes us from animals who are slave of impulses.   
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>The Tiktok Want!</title>
          <pubDate>Mon, 09 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
          <author>Unknown</author>
          <link>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/the-tiktok-want/</link>
          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/the-tiktok-want/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/the-tiktok-want/">&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&#x27;s been almost a year since Indian government banned TikTok. what is interesting here is that tiktok was banned not only because of political reasons but also because of social reasons. people, especially the ones with power thought that tiktok is degenerating their youth. but these boomers forgot that it was the &#x27;social&#x27; who was responsible for the tiktok i.e it was the market which had a need for an app like tiktok. market needed an app which can provide easy to consume 15 seconds long videos which are full of stimulus and most importantly super easy to edit. tiktok fulfilled this need.&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what has been the consequence of their decision? one year ago they banned one tiktok now there are over a dozen of tiktoks in the market. previously there was almost a monopoly of tiktok in this market. now different apps like moj, josh, mxtakatak etc.[1] are jumping like monkeys to get a bigger share of this newly vacated market. just look at the top charts of play store or app store, you can find plenty of these apps jumping there. before tiktok ban these apps didn&#x27;t even existed, or the ones which existed knew that they have lost this battle against tiktok. these apps, however with different names, are all the same. they are trying to satisfy the same want, the &#x27;tiktok want&#x27;: easy to consume 15 second long videos which are full of stimulus and most importantly super easy to edit.&lt;&#x2F;br&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;br&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;bigger players like youtube and facebook also know the significance of this newly generated &#x27;tiktok want&#x27;. so they created their own tiktoks- what do you think youtube shorts are? and what are facebook stories? or insagram stories? or maybe whatsapp status? and damn now even twitter has its stories! different name has been given to this evil need but goal is same i.e to satisfy the &#x27;tiktok want&#x27;: easy to consume 15 second long videos which are full of stimulus and most importantly super easy to edit.&lt;&#x2F;br&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;br&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;these new tiktok apps are laughing on the face of those old people who thought that banning tiktok would be the solution of those poor circumstances. little did our boomers knew that this &#x27;tiktok want&#x27; virus is soon going to take over their daily apps. now the boomers themselves are updating their whatsapp status which is edited by one of these tiktok apps. it turns out that tiktok is not just an app, it is a need (or a crude want) which is demanded by the market. tiktok can be banned from the market but the &#x27;tiktok want&#x27; can not be banned from the hearts of the people.&lt;&#x2F;br&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when prostitution is the problem you don&#x27;t ban a single prostitute but the whole activity of prostitution. when &#x27;tiktok want&#x27; is the problem you don&#x27;t ban a single tiktok but have to ban the whole activity which is related with the satisfaction of &#x27;tiktok want&#x27;. which in current circumstances seems not to be possible.&lt;&#x2F;br&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;br&gt;
&lt;a href=&#x2F;pix&#x2F;tiktok.png&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;pix&#x2F;tiktok.png&quot; alt=&quot;tiktok&quot; class=resmid&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a
&lt;p&gt;notes:&lt;&#x2F;br&gt;
[1] these apps have funny names but the times are depressing.&lt;&#x2F;br&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Poisoning of The Mind</title>
          <pubDate>Mon, 05 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
          <author>Unknown</author>

&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
from books being the hobby of only rich people to mass printing, and from village halls to internet, a lot has been changed. 100 years ago the means of getting information were so less that the question was &quot;how to get information&quot;. and now an average man is surrounded by so many equipments of getting information that now the question is not &quot;how to get information&quot; but &quot;what information to get&quot;.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it is easier now than ever to get one&#x27;s mind preoccupied by irrelevant ideas. ideas which have nothing to do with one&#x27;s real life situation. for example we can see people spending their valuable time on internet by defending irrelevant ideologies. these irrelevant ideologies are noting but parasites, they only flourish on internet and in the mind of internet users. what terrifying is that the person in whose mind these ideas live, forgets his real self and starts to identify himself with political ideologies. these parasite ideas are not only restricted to political ideologies they can also include choosing a group between religion vs atheism, this gender vs that gender, Linux vs windows groups etc. the point of these parasites is to occupy the mind of man. under the occupation of these parasites man goes farther and farther away from reality. and only sees the picture of the world through the filter of these parasites.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to further explain what i mean by &quot;seeing the world from the filter of these parasites&quot; lets see a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2021&#x2F;06&#x2F;02&#x2F;americans-in-news-media-bubbles-think-differently-about-foreign-policy-than-others&#x2F;&quot;&gt;work&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; done by pew research, where pew research found how people who are stuck in media bubbles have irrational stands about different problems, viewers of both CNN and fox news bubble have irrational opinions. this research also shows how the people who are stuck in media bubbles loose their ability to think critically. this is the poisoning of mind. CNN and fox news both are like parasites which live in the mind of their viewers. their viewers forget that world exists beyond democrats and republicans. viewers forgets other aspects of life and only talk about politics all the time. the question is do the viewrs really need to feed that much propaganda to their brain? is this much dose of irrelevant politics is good for mental health?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;more than a century ago, Arthur Schopenhauer, in his work &#x27;on books and reading&#x27;, wrote how a man poisons his mind by reading books of poor content i.e books of popular culture fiction, religious and political pamphlets etc. Arthur advices to learn the art of refraining from reading poor content of popular culture. he further claims that &quot;the man who writes for fools is always sure of a large audience&quot;. what one should do is to read great minds of all ages not all minds of current age. by this way, and only by this way one can prevent one&#x27;s mind from getting poisoning from poor content.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;back in the days people suffered because of less information now people are suffering from too much information. but if we compare two man, one from current times to the one from older times, the man from older times would be better off as at least his mind was not filled with the propaganda provided by different political groups and businesses.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
it is the skill of refraining which a man should learn now. thanks to technological advancements that there are way more things today which a man can read and watch which were unimaginable yesterday. the question shall not only be what to be read and watched but also what NOT to be read or watched.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;

          <title>So You Want To Buy a Dog?</title>

          <description xml:base="https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/so-you-want-to-buy-a-dog/">&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top: 1em&quot;&gt;dog lovers of the world, read my work. here i write my frustration about modern breding practices and idiot dog owners. i hope this work will help you in making better decison regarding dogs in future.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; unfortunate times
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top: 1em&quot;&gt;as rule of thumb when you
combine dumb people with free markets it results into
degradation of commodities. music which previously nourished
the soul of it&amp;rsquo;s listeners has now been degraded to
simply stimulus noise. just see the top trending music these
days. now dogs are also getting freely traded in the market.
what happened with music also happened with dogs. the dogs
which previously protected the house of it&amp;rsquo;s owner are
now degraded to clowns for Instagram. or the dogs which were
previously bred for work are now (mostly) being bred for
looks, only looks. and the only reason why dogs are getting
bred for looks is the market. the market, especially the
dumb section of it decides to buy dogs only because they
look good. that forces the dog breeders to breed dogs for
looks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top: 1em&quot;&gt;effect of breeding dog for mere
looks on different dog breeds:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top: 1em&quot;&gt;1- german shepherds which were
initially bred for courage, intelligence and muscular
strength now being destroyed because of the poor breeding of
this dog now german shepherds have problems including: hip
dysplasia[1] (decease caused by the demand for sloped back
german shepherds) and shyness.(because who cares about the
mental health of their german shepherd until he looks
good)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top: 1em&quot;&gt;2-Chihuahuas are bred for their
large head in relationship to the body. because of that:
&amp;quot;Chihuahua puppies have to be born through cesareans,
because the puppy&amp;rsquo;s heads are too big for natural
birth. There are also instances of open fontanels
(&amp;quot;Chihuahua molera&amp;quot;), which is seen as a breed
characteristic.&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top: 1em&quot;&gt;3- forget about diseases which
have been resulted due to poor breeding. breeds like
bulldogs can&amp;rsquo;t even mate naturally!!!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top: 1em&quot;&gt;the examples of poor breeding
can include any dog breed in the market. every single breed
is affected by this.[2]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; lesson learned
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top: 1em&quot;&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t buy a dog just
because it looks good. see your requirements i.e size of
your house, the amount of time you will be spending with the
dog, the job for which you want the dog whether it&amp;rsquo;s
for personal protection or live stock guarding, check if it
matches with the breed you want to buy. it often happens
that people buy the wrong breed for a particular job. i know
few people who bought a pit bull as a live stock guardian,
and as expected results were terrifying. taking pit bull as
LGD is like giving wolves the responsibility of guarding the
sheep.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;dog vs toy dog
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top: 1em&quot;&gt;a dog is one who gets food
because he does some work. whether it&amp;rsquo;s protection of
house or live stock or maybe working at border and so on. on
the other hand toy dog is one who gets food only because he
looks good. a dog has to work, a toy dog has to merely
exist.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#x2F;pix&#x2F;dogvstoydog.jpg&gt;&lt;img class=resmid src=&quot;&#x2F;pix&#x2F;dogvstoydog.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;dog&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;the best breeder in the world
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top: 1em&quot;&gt;natural selection is the best
breeder. and where it can be found? in the native breeds of
your country. i&amp;rsquo;m here only talking about those native
dogs who have the least human intervention in their
breeding. i.e no poor selective breeding. every country has
their native breeds. if possible go for them. there are
multiple good reasons for that. first of all nature has made
them according to the local environment, so that the chances
of putting a dog made for cold weather into a hot
environment can be eliminated.(there are many idiots who are
breeding huskies in thar desert, India. secondly, as native
dogs are made by the nature they are more healthy than those
fancy toy dogs. it will save you a good chunk of money which
you would have spent on your dog&amp;rsquo;s diagnosis. third,
native breeds are way more cheaper than those fancy ones,
and often you can just get them for free, if you know where
to go.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top: 1em&quot;&gt;but be aware that there are also
many local breeders who do poor breeding of native breeds.
it would be a good idea to get a native puppy from the
villages where the only breeder is natural selection. and
natural selection is the only breeder which can be
trusted.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;recently i decided to buy a new cycle for me. i choose to buy it from decathlon. the cheapest one. they provide good quality cycles, at least that&#x27;s what everyone said. so after deciding what i want to buy and from whom, i went to their store. rode it for a while in the store to check if everything is working fine before paying them. everything was fine, almost. there were parts missing. a lot of parts were missing from that cycle, no mudguard, there was option for water bottle holder but i can see no holder attached to it. no bell, not even cycle stand can be found on it! i thought they will assemble everything at checkout service. that these are just unfinished products. was i wrong? i was.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;at checkout:
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I: how much is the price again?&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
salesman: 5k&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
I: OK i&#x27;m making the payment, you tell them to assemble it.
salesman: assemble? it&#x27;s already assembled.&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
I: i&#x27;m talking about the parts like mudguard, ring, stand and others
salesman: sir, they are accessories.&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
I: accessories? stand is a accessory? do you want me to just drop my cycle on the road while i go to some store? stand is not a accessory but a necessity!&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
salesman: if you want the accessories we can add them.&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
I: and how much will they cost me?&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
salesman: mudguard is for rs500, water bottle holder is for rs200, water bottle is for rs200, bell is for rs200, seat cover is for rs150, stand is for rs500...your total will be  rs6200&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
I: a stand for rs500, in the market it costs only rs150 to buy it!&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
salesman: it is what it is. &lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
I: if the complete product costs 6200 then why are you claiming it to be for 5000?&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
salesman: umm..ahhh...company decides it...
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;pix&#x2F;soycle.jpg&quot; class=&quot;resmid&quot;&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;understanding the problem&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cycle industry is the case of monopolistic competition. decathlon is not the only company selling cycles. there are other competitors like hero, atlas, Firefox and many more. they do not sell completely identical products but at the end they are just cycles with different marketing groups. charging only rs500 more than the competitor can lead the costumer to choose the other brand. this is cut throat competition.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hence to fight competition companies have these three options:
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;first,is to charge lower price to attract costumers. but it has the downside that it will reduce the companies&#x27;s profit even more and company may also has to incur loss because in competition companies already earn only average revenue. average revenue is just enough for the survival for the company. reducing average revenue by lowering the prices will be a sure recipe to enter into company closure.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;second, do better marketing than the competition. make people see beautiful imaginary lands in the company logo like the devotes see god in murti (statue) which are made up of stones. something which the apple has successfully done. but only if it was that easy to build brand image like apple every company would have done it.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;third, &quot;the necessary result of this competition is a general deterioration of commodities, adulteration, fake production and universal poisoning.&quot;(karl marx) so if reducing the price will lead to loss and brand image building is easier said then done, then why not just use inferior raw materials to reduce cost and earn surplus profit. but making inferior quality products and selling them to costumers does not work in long run. as the saying goes: you can fool some of the people all the time, some of the people some of the time, but can&#x27;t fool all the people all the time. costumers in long run can find which product is good for price and which is not. so this option does&#x27;t work either.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;the fourth way: my way or highway&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the companies have found the most evil solution.
to understand this solution.&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
we must first review the problems from the perspective of the cycle companies: &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1- if they increase price they will loose consumer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2- if they decrease price they will loose profit.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so if the price is the only problem then why not just reduce the price and still earn profit.
how?&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
by reducing the product.&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
how to reduce product?&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
remove the mudguard etc. and it will lower the price. consumer is fool. he will think that our cycle is cheaper than the other and fall in the trap of buying it.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and, company will reduce the price of this unfinished product so much that it will earn only minimal profit.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but then what&#x27;s the point of selling unfinished product if the company earns only minimal profit?&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
the unfinished product (cycle) is just a trap. the company will earn surplus profit from it&#x27;s accessories. company will overcharge on it&#x27;s accessories. the cycle will be reduced to only an instrument by which the company will sell the overpriced accessories. once the costumer buys unfinished cycle the cycle company gets monopoly over it&#x27;s accessories which enables the company to overcharge for it&#x27;s accessories. and earn surplus profit by exploiting it&#x27;s costumers without letting them know.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this technique of selling unfinished products at lower price than competition and then earning surplus profit from accessories is not limited to only cycle industry. we can see the same happening in car, motorbike industry too. everywhere the basic price to acquire a product is reasonable but when price of accessories are added to them, the products turns out to be overpriced. that&#x27;s why car accessories are overpriced, because the company earns more profit from it&#x27;s accessories than the real product.(car)
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;company likes to call them accessories but in reality they are necessities. and the company know this. it knows without these necessities their product is useless so the costumers will have to buy the overpriced accessories in order to use the product.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
